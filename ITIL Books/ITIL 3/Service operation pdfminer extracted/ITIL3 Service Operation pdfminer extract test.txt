OGC’s foreword

Since its creation, ITIL has grown to become the most
widely accepted approach to IT service management in
the world. However, along with this success comes the
responsibility to ensure that the guidance keeps pace with
a changing global business environment. Service
management requirements are inevitably shaped by the
development of technology, revised business models and
increasing customer expectations. Our latest version of ITIL
has been created in response to these developments.

This is one of the five core publications describing the IT
service management practices that make up ITIL. They are
the result of a two-year project to review and update the
guidance. The number of service management
professionals around the world who have helped to
develop the content of these publications is impressive.
Their experience and knowledge have contributed to the
content to bring you a consistent set of high-quality
guidance. This is supported by the ongoing development
of a comprehensive qualifications scheme, along with
accredited training and consultancy.

Whether you are part of a global company, a government
department or a small business, ITIL gives you access to
world-class service management expertise. Essentially, it
puts IT services where they belong – at the heart of
successful business operations.

Chief Architect’s foreword

ITIL Service Management Practice guidance is structured
around the Service Lifecycle. Common across the lifecycle
is the overall practice itself, which relies on processes,
functions, activities, organizational models and
measurement, which together allow IT Service
Management (ITSM) to integrate with the business
processes, provide measurable value and evolve the ITSM
industry forward in our pursuit of service excellence.

Nowhere else in the ITIL Service Lifecycle does the effect
of how we perform as service providers touch the
customers as intimately as Service Operations. This is
where the strategy, design, transition and improvements
are delivered and supported on a day-to-day basis.

The Service Operation publication brings Service
Management to life for the business, and the
accountability for the performance of the services, the
people who create them and the technology that enables
them are monitored, controlled and delivered in this stage
of the Service Lifecycle.

This publication will help guide us all to achieve service
excellence and to see the value of ITSM in a broad,
business-focused view of it. Whether you are new to the
practice of ITIL or a seasoned practitioner, the guidance in
this publication will expand your vision and knowledge of
how to be the best-of-breed service provider through
implementation of Service Operation.

There is a saying that hindsight is 20/20. The guidance in
Service Operation is distilled from over 20 years of
experience in ITSM by world experts, business people and
ITSM practitioners and the lessons learned by them about
what service excellence really is and how to achieve it.

Anyone involved in operating services will benefit from
the guidance in the following pages of this publication.
Service Operation offers the best advice and guidance
from around the world and a path to what is possible in 
your future.

Preface

This publication encompasses and supersedes the
operational aspects of the ITIL Service Support and Service
Delivery publications and also covers most of the scope of
ICT infrastructure Management. It also incorporates
operational aspects from the Planning to Implement,
Application Management, Software Asset Management
and Security Management publications.

The basic principles of best practice IT service
management encompassed within earlier versions of 
ITIL remain unchanged. Common sense remains 
common sense!

However, the technologies, tools and relationships 
have changed significantly, even in the relatively short
time since the latest version of ITIL was completed. Whilst
this publication re-uses and updates relevant material
from the earlier versions where appropriate, it also
includes many new concepts and industry practices to
give complete coverage of best-practice guidance for
today’s Service Operation in a single volume, for today’s
business and technological environment.

1 Introduction

This publication provides best-practice advice and
guidance on all aspects of managing the day-to-day
operation of an organization’s information technology (IT)
services. It covers issues relating to the people, processes,
infrastructure technology and relationships necessary to
ensure the high-quality, cost-effective provision of IT
service necessary to meet business needs.

The advent of new technology and the now blurred lines
between the traditional technology silos of hardware,
networks, telephony and software applications
management mean that an updated approach to
managing service operations is needed. Organizations are
increasingly likely to consider different ways of providing
their IT at optimum cost and flexibility, with the
introduction of utility IT, pay-per-use IT Services, virtual IT
provision, dynamic capacity and Adaptive Enterprise
computing, as well as task-sourcing and outsourcing
options.

These alternatives have led to a myriad of IT business
relationships, both internally and externally, that have
increased in complexity as much as the technologies
being managed have. Business dependency on these
complex relationships is increasingly critical to survival 
and prosperity.

1.1 OVERVIEW

Service Operation is the phase in the ITSM Lifecycle that is
responsible for ‘business-as-usual’ activities.

Service Operation can be viewed as the ‘factory’ of IT. 
This implies a closer focus on the day-to-day activities 
and infrastructure that are used to deliver services.
However, this publication is based on the understanding 
that the overriding purpose of Service Operation is to
deliver and support services. Management of the
infrastructure and the operational activities must 
always support this purpose.

Well planned and implemented processes will be to no
avail if the day-to-day operation of those processes is not
properly conducted, controlled and managed. Nor will
service improvements be possible if day-to-day activities
to monitor performance, assess metrics and gather data
are not systematically conducted during Service Operation.

Service Operation staff should have in place processes and
support tools to allow them to have an overall view of
Service Operation and delivery (rather than just the

separate components, such as hardware, software
applications and networks, that make up the end-to-end
service from a business perspective) and to detect any
threats or failures to service quality.

As services may be provided, in whole or in part, by one
or more partner/supplier organizations, the Service
Operation view of end-to-end service must be extended to
encompass external aspects of service provision – and
where necessary shared or interfacing processes and tools
are needed to manage cross-organizational workflows.

Service Operation is neither an organizational unit nor a
single process – but it does include several functions and
many processes and activities, which are described in
Chapters 4, 5 and 6.

1.2 CONTEXT

1.2.1 Service Management
IT is a commonly used term that changes meaning with
context. From the first perspective, IT systems, applications
and infrastructure are components or sub-assemblies of a
larger product. They enable or are embedded in processes
and services. From the second perspective, IT is an
organization with its own set of capabilities and resources.
IT organizations can be of various types such as business
functions, shared services units and enterprise-level core
units.

From the third perspective, IT is a category of services
utilized by business. They are typically IT applications and
infrastructure that are packaged and offered as services by
internal IT organizations or external service providers. IT
costs are treated as business expenses. From the fourth
perspective, IT is a category of business assets that provide
a stream of benefits for their owners, including, but not
limited to, revenue, income and profit. IT costs are treated
as investments.

1.2.2 Good practice in the public domain
Organizations operate in dynamic environments with the
need to learn and adapt. There is a need to improve
performance while managing trade-offs. Under similar
pressure, customers seek advantage from service
providers. They pursue sourcing strategies that best serve
their own business interest. In many countries,
government agencies and non-profit-making enterprises
have a similar propensity to outsource for the sake of

operational effectiveness. This puts additional pressure on
service providers to maintain a competitive advantage
with regard to the alternatives that customers may have.
The increase in outsourcing has particularly exposed
internal service providers to unusual competition.

To cope with the pressure, organizations benchmark
themselves against peers and seek to close gaps in
capabilities. One way to close such gaps is the adoption of
good practices across the industry. There are several
sources for good practices, including public frameworks,
standards and the proprietary knowledge of organizations
and individuals (see Figure 1.1).

Public frameworks and standards are attractive when
compared with proprietary knowledge:

■ Proprietary knowledge is deeply embedded in
organizations and therefore difficult to adopt, 
replicate or transfer, even with the cooperation of 
the owners. Such knowledge is often in the form 
of tacit knowledge which is inextricable and 
poorly documented.

■ Proprietary knowledge is customized for the local

context and specific business needs, to the point of
being idiosyncratic. Unless the recipients of such

knowledge have matching circumstances, the
knowledge may not be as effective in use.

■ Owners of proprietary knowledge expect to be

rewarded for their long-term investments. 
They may make such knowledge available only 
under commercial terms, through purchases and
licensing agreements.

■ Publicly available frameworks and standards such as

ITIL, Control Objectives for IT (COBIT), CMMI, eSCM-SP,
PRINCE2, ISO 9000, ISO 20000 and ISO 27001 are
validated across a diverse set of environments and
situations rather than the limited experience of a
single organization. They are subject to broad 
review across multiple organizations and disciplines.
They are vetted by diverse sets of partners, suppliers
and competitors.

■ The knowledge of public frameworks is more likely to

be widely distributed among a large community of
professionals through publicly available training and
certification. It is easier for organizations to acquire
such knowledge through the labour market.

Ignoring public frameworks and standards can needlessly
place an organization at a disadvantage. Organizations
should cultivate their own proprietary knowledge on top

of a body of knowledge based on public frameworks and
standards. Collaboration and coordination across
organizations are easier on the basis of shared practices
and standards.

1.2.3 ITIL and good practice in Service
Management
The context of this publication is the ITIL Framework as a
source of good practice in Service Management. ITIL is
used by organizations worldwide to establish and improve
capabilities in Service Management. ISO/IEC 20000
provides a formal and universal standard for organizations
seeking to have their Service Management capabilities
audited and certified. While ISO/IEC 20000 is a standard to
be achieved and maintained, ITIL offers a body of
knowledge useful for achieving the standard.

The ITIL Library has the following components:

■ ITIL Core: best-practice guidance applicable to all

types of organizations that provide services to a
business

■ ITIL Complementary Guidance: a complementary set

of publications with guidance specific to industry
sectors, organization types, operating models and
technology architectures.

The ITIL Core consists of five publications (see Figure 1.2).
Each provides the guidance necessary for an integrated
approach as required by the ISO/IEC 20000 standard
specification:

Figure 1.2 ITIL Core

■ Service Strategy
■ Service Design
■ Service Transition
■ Service Operation
■ Continual Service Improvement.

Each publication addresses capabilities having direct
impact on a service provider’s performance. The structure
of the core is in the form of a lifecycle. It is iterative and
multidimensional. It ensures that organizations are set up
to leverage capabilities in one area for learning and
improvements in others. The Core is expected to provide
structure, stability and strength to Service Management
capabilities, with durable principles, methods and tools.
This serves to protect investments and provide the
necessary basis for measurement, learning and
improvement.

The guidance in ITIL can be adapted for changes of use in
various business environments and organizational
strategies. The Complementary Guidance provides
flexibility to implement the Core in a diverse range of
environments. Practitioners can select Complementary
Guidance as needed to provide traction for the Core in a
given business context, much as tyres are selected based
on the type of automobile, purpose and road conditions.
This is to increase the durability and portability of
knowledge assets and to protect investments in Service
Management capabilities.

Introduction

1.2.3.1 Service Strategy
The Service Strategy volume provides guidance on how to
design, develop and implement Service Management, not
only as an organizational capability but also as a strategic
asset. Guidance is provided on the principles underpinning
the practice of Service Management which are useful for
developing Service Management policies, guidelines and
processes across the ITIL Service Lifecycle. Service Strategy
guidance is useful in the context of Service Design, Service
Transition, Service Operation and Continual Service
Improvement. Topics covered in Service Strategy include
the development of markets, internal and external, service
assets, service catalogue and implementation of strategy
through the Service Lifecycle. Financial Management,
Service Portfolio Management, Organizational
Development and Strategic Risks are among other
major topics.

Organizations use the guidance to set objectives and
expectations of performance towards serving customers
and market spaces and to identify, select and prioritize
opportunities. Service Strategy is about ensuring that
organizations are in a position to handle the costs and
risks associated with their service portfolios and are set up
not just for operational effectiveness but for distinctive
performance. Decisions made with regard to Service
Strategy have far-reaching consequences, including those
with delayed effect.

Organizations already practising ITIL use this volume to
guide a strategic review of their ITIL-based Service
Management capabilities and to improve the alignment
between those capabilities and their business strategies.
This volume of ITIL encourages readers to stop and think
about why something is to be done before thinking of
how. Answers to the first type of questions are closer to
the customer’s business. Service Strategy expands the
scope of the ITIL Framework beyond the traditional
audience of ITSM professionals.

1.2.3.2 Service Design
The Service Design volume provides guidance for the
design and development of services and service
management processes. It covers design principles and
methods for converting strategic objectives into portfolios
of services and service assets. The scope of Service Design
is not limited to new services. It includes the changes and
improvements necessary to increase or maintain value to
customers over the lifecycle of services, the continuity of
services, achievement of service levels and conformance to
standards and regulations. It guides organizations on how
to develop design capabilities for Service Management.

1.2.3.3 Service Transition
The Service Transition volume provides guidance for the
development and improvement of capabilities for
transitioning new and changed services into operations.
This publication provides guidance on how the
requirements of Service Strategy encoded in Service
Design are effectively realized in Service Operations while
controlling the risks of failure and disruption. The
publication combines practices in Release Management,
Programme Management and Risk Management and
places them in the practical context of Service
Management. It provides guidance on managing the
complexity related to changes to services and Service
Management processes, preventing undesired
consequences while allowing for innovation. Guidance is
provided on transferring the control of services between
customers and service providers.

1.2.3.4 Service Operation
This volume embodies practices in the management of
Service Operations. It includes guidance on achieving
effectiveness and efficiency in the delivery and support of
services so as to ensure value for the customer and the
service provider. Strategic objectives are ultimately realized
through Service Operations, therefore making it a critical
capability. Guidance is provided on how to maintain
stability in Service Operations, allowing for changes in
design, scale, scope and service levels. Organizations are
provided with detailed process guidelines, methods and
tools for use in two major control perspectives: reactive
and proactive. Managers and practitioners are provided
with knowledge allowing them to make better decisions in
areas such as managing the availability of services,
controlling demand, optimizing capacity utilization,
scheduling of operations and fixing problems. Guidance is
provided on supporting operations through new models
and architectures such as shared services, utility
computing, web services and mobile commerce.

1.2.3.5 Continual Service Improvement
This volume provides instrumental guidance in creating
and maintaining value for customers through better
design, introduction and operation of services. It combines
principles, practices and methods from Quality
Management, Change Management and Capability
Improvement. Organizations learn to realize incremental
and large-scale improvements in service quality,
operational efficiency and business continuity. Guidance is
provided for linking improvement efforts and outcomes
with Service Strategy, Service Design and Service
Transition. A closed-loop feedback system, based on the

Introduction  |

7

Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA) model specified in ISO/IEC
20000, is established and capable of receiving inputs for
change from any planning perspective.

The day-to-day operational management of IT Services is
significantly influenced by how well an organization’s
overall IT service strategy has been defined and how well
the ITSM processes have been planned and implemented.
This is the fourth publication in the ITIL Service
Management Practices series and the other publications
on Service Strategy, Service Design and Service Transition
should be consulted for best practice guidance on these
important stages prior to Service Operation.

Service Operation is extremely important, as it is on a day-
to-day operational basis that events occur which can
adversely impact service quality. The way in which an
organization’s IT infrastructure and its supporting ITSM
processes are operated will have the most direct and
immediate short-term bearing upon service quality.

1.3 PURPOSE

Service Operation is a critical phase of the ITSM lifecycle.
Well-planned and well-implemented processes will be to
no avail if the day-to-day operation of those processes is
not properly conducted, controlled and managed. Nor will
service improvements be possible if day-to-day activities
to monitor performance, assess metrics and gather data
are not systematically conducted during Service Operation.

Service Operation staff should have in place processes and
support tools to allow them to have an overall view of
Service Operation and delivery (rather than just the
separate components, such as hardware, software
applications and networks, that make up the end-to-end
service from a business perspective) and to detect any
threats or failures to service quality.

As services may be provided, in whole or in part, by one
or more partner/supplier organizations, the Service
Operation view of end-to-end service must be extended to
encompass external aspects of service provision – and
where necessary shared or interfacing processes and tools
are needed to manage cross-organizational workflows.

1.4 USAGE

This publication should be used in conjunction with the
other four publications that make up the ITIL Service
Lifecycle.

Readers should be aware that the best-practice guidelines
in this and other volumes are not intended to be
prescriptive. Each organization is unique and must ‘adapt

and adopt’ the guidance for its own specific needs,
environment and culture. This will involve taking into
account the organization’s size, skills/resources, culture,
funding, priorities and existing ITSM maturity and
modifying the guidance as appropriate to suit the
organization’s needs.

For organizations finding ITIL for the first time, some form
of initial assessment to compare the organization’s current
processes and practices with those recommended by ITIL
would be a very valuable starting point. These assessments
are described in more detail in the ITIL Continual Service
Improvement publication.

Where significant gaps exist, it may be necessary to
address them in stages over a period of time to meet the
organization’s business priorities and keep pace with what
the organization is able to absorb and afford.

1.5 CHAPTER OVERVIEW

Chapter 2 introduces the concept of Service Management
as a practice. Here, Service Management is positioned as a
strategic and professional component of any organization.
This chapter also provides an overview of Service
Operation as a critical component of the Service
Management Practice.

The key principles of Service Operation are covered in
Chapter 3 of this publication. These principles outline
some of the basic concepts and principles on which the
rest of the publication is based.

Chapter 4 covers the processes performed within Service
Operation – most of the Service Operation processes are
reactive because of the nature of the work being
performed to maintain IT services in a robust, stable
condition. This chapter also covers proactive processes to
emphasize that the aim of Service Operation is stability –
but not stagnation. Service Operation should be constantly
looking at ways of doing things better and more cost-
effectively, and the proactive processes have an important
role to play here.

Chapter 5 covers a number of Common Service Operation
activities, which are groups of activities and procedures
performed by Service Operation Functions. These
specialized, and often technical, activities are not
processes in the true sense of the word, but they are all
vital for the ability to deliver quality IT services at optimal
cost.

Chapter 6 covers the organizational aspects of Service
Operation – the individuals or groups who carry out
Service Operation processes or activities – and includes

8

|

Introduction

some guidance on Service Operation organization
structures.

Chapter 7 describes the tools and technology that are
used during Service Operation.

Chapter 8 covers some aspects of implementation that will
need to be considered before the operational phase of the
lifecycle becomes active.

Chapter 9 highlights the challenges, Critical Success
Factors and risks faced during Service Operation, while the
Afterword summarizes and concludes the publication.

ITIL does not stand alone in providing guidance to IT
managers and the appendices outline some of the key
supplementary frameworks, methodologies and
approaches that are commonly used in conjunction with
ITIL during Service Operation.

2 Service Management as a practice

2.1 WHAT IS SERVICE MANAGEMENT?

■ The perishable nature of service output and service

Service Management is a set of specialized organizational
capabilities for providing value to customers in the form of
services. The capabilities take the form of functions and
processes for managing services over a lifecycle, with
specializations in strategy, design, transition, operation and
continual improvement. The capabilities represent a
service organization’s capacity, competency and
confidence for action. The act of transforming resources
into valuable services is at the core of Service
Management. Without these capabilities, a service
organization is merely a bundle of resources that by itself
has relatively low intrinsic value for customers.

Definition of Service Management

Service Management is a set of specialized
organizational capabilities for providing value to
customers in the form of services.

Organizational capabilities are shaped by the challenges
they are expected to overcome. An example of this is how
in the 1950s Toyota developed unique capabilities to
overcome the challenge of smaller scale and financial
capital compared to its American rivals. Toyota developed
new capabilities in production engineering, operations
management and managing suppliers to compensate for
its inability to afford large inventories, make components,
produce raw materials or own the companies that
produced them. [Source: Magretta, Joan 2002. What
Management Is: How it works and why it’s everyone’s
business. The Free Press.] Service Management capabilities
are similarly influenced by the following challenges that
distinguish services from other systems of value-creation,
such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture:

■ Intangible nature of the output and intermediate

products of service processes: Difficult to measure,
control and validate (or prove).

■ Demand is tightly coupled with the customer’s assets:

Users and other customer assets such as processes,
applications, documents and transactions arrive with
demand and stimulate service production.

■ High level of contact for producers and consumers of
services: Little or no buffer between the customer, the
front-office and the back-office.

capacity: There is value for the customer from
assurance on the continued supply of consistent
quality. Providers need to secure a steady supply 
of demand from customers.

However, Service Management is more than just a set of
capabilities. It is also a professional practice supported by
an extensive body of knowledge, experience and skills. A
global community of individuals and organizations in the
public and private sectors fosters its growth and maturity.
Formal schemes exist for the education, training and
certification of practising organizations and individuals
influence its quality. Industry best practices, academic
research and formal standards contribute to its intellectual
capital and draw from it.

The origins of Service Management are in traditional
service businesses such as airlines, banks, hotels and
phone companies. Its practice has grown with the
adoption by IT organizations of a service-oriented
approach to managing IT applications, infrastructure and
processes. Solutions to business problems and support for
business models, strategies and operations are increasingly
in the form of services. The popularity of shared services
and outsourcing has contributed to the increase in the
number of organizations that are service providers,
including internal organizational units. This in turn has
strengthened the practice of Service Management and at
the same time imposed greater challenges upon it.

2.2 WHAT ARE SERVICES?

2.2.1 The value proposition

Definition of service

A service is a means of delivering value to customers
by facilitating outcomes customers want to achieve,
without the ownership of specific costs and risks.

Services are a means of delivering value to customers by
facilitating outcomes customers want to achieve, without
the ownership of specific costs and risks. Services facilitate
outcomes by enhancing the performance of associated
tasks and reducing the effect of constraints. The result is
an increase in the probability of desired outcomes.

12

| Service Management as a practice

I must ask, do you
have a definition
for services?

What would that mean
in operational terms?
Give me a few handles.

But without the ownership of
costs and risks? Customers
cannot wish them away.

Aha! Because the provider is
specialized with capabilities for
dealing with those costs and risks.

I believe services are a means of delivering value by
facilitating outcomes customers want to achieve
without the ownership of specific costs and risks.

Well, services facilitate outcomes by
having a positive effect on activities,
objects and tasks, to create conditions for
better performance. As a result, the
probability of desired outcomes is higher.

Manager

(Operations)

Manager
(Strategy)

No, they cannot but what they can do is
let the provider take ownership. That’s
really why it is a service. If customers
manage it all by themselves, they
wouldn’t need a service would they?

(A casual conversation
at the water-cooler)

Yes, and also because the customer
would rather specialize in those outcomes.

And also because the provider can
potentially spread those costs and risks
across more than one customer.

Let’s write a book on
service management!

Figure 2.1 A conversation about the definition and meaning of services

2.3 FUNCTIONS AND PROCESSES ACROSS
THE LIFECYCLE

2.3.1 Functions
Functions are units of organizations specialized to perform
certain types of work and responsible for specific
outcomes. They are self-contained, with capabilities and
resources necessary for their performance and outcomes.
Capabilities include work methods internal to the
functions. Functions have their own body of knowledge,
which accumulates from experience. They provide
structure and stability to organizations.

Functions are a means of structuring organizations so as
to implement the specialization principle. Functions
typically define roles and the associated authority and
responsibility for a specific performance and outcomes.
Coordination between functions through shared processes
is a common pattern in organization design. Functions
tend to optimize their work methods locally, to focus on
assigned outcomes. Poor coordination between functions,
combined with an inward focus, leads to functional silos
that hinder alignment and feedback critical to the success
of the organization as a whole. Process models help avoid
this problem with functional hierarchies by improving
cross-functional coordination and control. Well-defined
processes can improve productivity within and across
functions.

2.3.2 Processes
Processes are examples of closed-loop systems because
they provide change and transformation towards a goal
and utilize feedback for self-reinforcing and self-corrective
action (see Figure 2.2). It is important to consider the
entire process or how one process fits into another.

Process definitions describe actions, dependencies and
sequence. Processes have the following characteristics:

■ Measurable: We are able to measure the process in a

relevant manner. It is performance driven. Managers
want to measure cost, quality and other variables,
while practitioners are concerned with duration and
productivity.

■ Specific results: The reason a process exists is to

deliver a specific result. This result must be individually
identifiable and countable. While we can count
changes, it is impossible to count how many Service
Desks were completed.

■ Customers: Every process delivers its primary results

to a customer or stakeholder. They may be internal or
external to the organization but the process must
meet their expectations.

■ Responds to a specific event: While a process may

be ongoing or iterative, it should be traceable to a
specific trigger.

Figure 2.2 A basic process

Functions are often mistaken for processes. For example,
there are misconceptions about Capacity Management
being a Service Management process. First, Capacity
Management is an organizational capability with
specialized processes and work methods. Whether it is a
function or a process depends entirely on organization
design. It is a mistake to assume that Capacity
Management can only be a process. It is possible to
measure and control capacity and to determine whether it
is adequate for a given purpose. Assuming that it is always
a process, with discrete countable outcomes, can be an
error.

2.3.3 Specialization and coordination across
the lifecycle
Specialization and coordination are necessary in the
lifecycle approach. Feedback and control between the
functions and processes within and across the elements of
the lifecycle make this possible. The dominant pattern in
the lifecycle is the sequential progress starting from SS
through SD-ST-SO and back to SS through CSI. However,
that is not the only pattern of action. Every element of the
lifecycle provides points for feedback and control.

The combination of multiple perspectives allows greater
flexibility and control across environments and situations.
The lifecycle approach mimics the reality of most
organizations where effective management requires the
use of multiple control perspectives. Those responsible for
the design, development and improvement of processes
for Service Management can adopt a process-based
control perspective. Those responsible for managing
agreements, contracts and services may be better served
by a lifecycle-based control perspective with distinct
phases. Both these control perspectives benefit from

systems thinking. Each control perspective can reveal
patterns that may not be apparent from the other.

2.4 SERVICE OPERATION FUNDAMENTALS

2.4.1 Purpose/goal/objective
The purpose of Service Operation is to coordinate and
carry out the activities and processes required to deliver
and manage services at agreed levels to business users
and customers. Service Operation is also responsible for
the ongoing management of the technology that is used
to deliver and support services.

Well-designed and well-implemented processes will be of
little value if the day-to-day operation of those processes
is not properly conducted, controlled and managed. Nor
will service improvements be possible if day-to-day
activities to monitor performance, assess metrics and
gather data are not systematically conducted during
Service Operation.

2.4.2 Scope
Service Operation includes the execution of all ongoing
activities required to deliver and support services. The
scope of Service Operation includes:

■ The services themselves. Any activity that forms part
of a service is included in Service Operation, whether
it is performed by the Service Provider, an external
supplier or the user or customer of that service
■ Service Management processes. The ongoing

management and execution of many Service
Management processes are performed in Service
Operation, even though a number of ITIL processes

14

| Service Management as a practice

(such as Change and Capacity Management) originate
at the Service Design or Service Transition stage 
of the Service Lifecycle, they are in use continually 
in Service Operation. Some processes are not 
included specifically in Service Operation, such as
Strategy Definition, the actual design process itself.
These processes focus more on longer-term planning
and improvement activities, which are outside the
direct scope of Service Operation; however, 
Service Operation provides input and influences 
these regularly as part of the lifecycle of 
Service Management.

■ Technology. All services require some form of

technology to deliver them. Managing this technology
is not a separate issue, but an integral part of the
management of the services themselves. Therefore a
large part of this publication is concerned with the
management of the infrastructure used to deliver
services.

■ People. Regardless of what services, processes and

technology are managed, they are all about people. It
is people who drive the demand for the organization’s
services and products and it is people who decide
how this will be done. Ultimately, it is people who
manage the technology, processes and services.
Failure to recognize this will result (and has resulted)
in the failure of Service Management projects

2.4.3 Value to business
Each stage in the ITIL Service Lifecycle provides value to
business. For example, service value is modelled in Service
Strategy; the cost of the service is designed, predicted and
validated in Service Design and Service Transition; and
measures for optimization are identified in Continual
Service Improvement. The operation of service is where
these plans, designs and optimizations are executed and
measured. From a customer viewpoint, Service Operation
is where actual value is seen.

There is a down side to this, though:

■ Once a service has been designed and tested, it is

expected to run within the budgetary and Return on
Investment targets established earlier in the lifecycle.
In reality, however, very few organizations plan
effectively for the costs of ongoing management of
services. It is very easy to quantify the costs of a
project, but very difficult to quantify what the service
will cost after three years of operation.

■ It is difficult to obtain funding during the operational
phase, to fix design flaws or unforeseen requirements
– since this was not part of the original value
proposition. In many cases it is only after some time in
operation that these problems surface. Most
organizations do not have a formal mechanism to
review operational services for design and value. This
is left to Incident and Problem Management to resolve
– as if it is purely an operational issue.

■ It is difficult to obtain additional funding for tools or

actions (including training) aimed at improving the
efficiency of Service Operation. This is partly because
they are not directly linked to the functionality of a
specific service and partly because there is an
expectation from the customer that these costs should
have been built into the cost of the service from the
beginning. Unfortunately, the rate of technology
change is very high. Shortly after a solution has been
deployed that will efficiently manage a set of services,
new technology becomes available that can do it
faster, cheaper and more effectively.

■ Once a service has been operational for some time, it

becomes part of the baseline of what the business
expects from the IT services. Attempts to optimize the
service or to use new tools to manage it more
effectively are seen as successful only if the service has
been very problematic in the past. In other words,
some services are taken for granted and any action to
optimize them is perceived as ‘fixing services that are
not broken’.

This publication suggests a number of processes, functions
and measures which are aimed at addressing these areas.

2.4.4 Optimizing Service Operation
performance
Service Operation is optimized in two ways:

■ Long-term incremental improvement. This is based

on evaluating the performance and output of all
Service Operation processes, functions and outputs
over time. The reports are analysed and a decision
made about whether improvement is needed and, if
so, how best to implement it through Service Design
and Transition. Examples include the deployment of a
new set of tools, changes to process designs,
reconfiguration of the infrastructure, etc. This type of
improvement is covered in detail in the Continual
Service Improvement publication.

■ Short-term ongoing improvement of working
practices within the Service Operation processes,
functions and technology itself. These are generally
smaller improvements that are implemented without
any change to the fundamental nature of a process or
technology. Examples include tuning, workload
balancing, personnel redeployment and training, etc.

Although both of these are discussed in some detail within
the scope of Service Operation, the Continual Service
Improvement publication will provide a framework and
alternatives within which improvement may be driven as
part of the overall support of business objectives.

2.4.5 Processes within Service Operation
There are a number of key Service Operation processes
that must link together to provide an effective overall IT
support structure. The overall structure is briefly described
here and then each of the processes is described in more
detail in Chapter 4.

2.4.5.1 Event Management
Event Management monitors all events that occur
throughout the IT infrastructure, to monitor normal
operation and to detect and escalate exception conditions.

2.4.5.2 Incident and Problem Management
Incident Management concentrates on restoring
unexpectedly degraded or disrupted services to users as
quickly as possible, in order to minimize business impact.

Problem Management involves: root-cause analysis to
determine and resolve the cause of incidents, proactive
activities to detect and prevent future problems/incidents
and a Known Error sub-process to allow quicker diagnosis
and resolution if further incidents do occur.

2.4.5.3 Request Fulfilment
Request Fulfilment is the process for dealing with Service
Requests – many of them actually smaller, lower-risk,
changes – initially via the Service Desk, but using a
separate process similar to that of Incident Management
but with separate Request Fulfilment records/tables –
where necessary linked to the Incident or Problem
Record(s) that initiated the need for the request. To be a
Service Request, it is normal for some prerequisites to be
defined and met (e.g. needs to be proven, repeatable, pre-
approved, proceduralized).

Service Management as a practice  |

15

In order to resolve one or more incidents, problems or
Known Errors, some form of change may be necessary.
Smaller, often standard, changes can be handled through
a Request Fulfilment process, but larger, higher-risk or
infrequent changes must go through a formal Change
Management process.

2.4.5.4 Access Management
Access Management is the process of granting authorized
users the right to use a service, while restricting access to
non-authorized users. It is based on being able accurately
to identify authorized users and then manage their ability
to access services as required during different stages of
their Human Resources (HR) or contractual lifecycle. Access
Management has also been called Identity or Rights
Management in some organizations.

2.4.6 Functions within Service Operation
Processes alone will not result in effective Service
Operation. A stable infrastructure and appropriately skilled
people are needed as well. To achieve this, Service
Operation relies on several groups of skilled people, all
focused on using processes to match the capability of the
infrastructure to the needs of the business.

These groups fall into four main functions, listed here and
discussed in detail in Chapter 6.

2.4.6.1 Service Desk
The Service Desk is the primary point of contact for users
when there is a service disruption, for Service Requests, or
even for some categories of Request for Change. The
Service Desk provides a point of communication to the
users and a point of coordination for several IT groups 
and processes

2.4.6.2 Technical Management
Technical Management provides detailed technical skills
and resources needed to support the ongoing operation
of the IT Infrastructure. Technical Management also plays
an important role in the design, testing, release and
improvement of IT services. In small organizations, it is
possible to manage this expertise in a single department,
but larger organizations are typically split into a number 
of technically specialized departments.

■ Financial Management, which is covered in the Service

Strategy publication.

■ Knowledge Management, which is covered in the

Service Transition publication.

■ IT Service Continuity, which is covered in the Service

Design publication.

■ Service Reporting and Measurement, which are
covered in the Continual Service Improvement
publication.

16

| Service Management as a practice

2.4.6.3 IT Operations Management
IT Operations Management executes the daily operational
activities needed to manage the IT Infrastructure. This is
done according to the Performance Standards defined
during Service Design. In some organizations this is a
single, centralized department, while in others some
activities and staff are centralized and some are provided
by distributed or specialized departments. IT Operations
Management has two functions that are unique and are
generally formal organizational structures. These are:

■ IT Operations Control, which is generally staffed by
shifts of operators and which ensures that routine
operational tasks are carried out. IT Operations Control
will also provide centralized monitoring and control
activities, usually using an Operations Bridge or
Network Operations Centre.

■ Facilities Management refers to the management of
the physical IT environment, usually data centres or
computer rooms. In many organizations Technical and
Application Management are co-located with IT
Operations in large data centres.

2.4.6.4 Application Management
Application Management is responsible for managing
Applications throughout their lifecycle. The Application
Management function supports and maintains operational
applications and also plays an important role in the
design, testing and improvement of applications that form
part of IT services. Application Management is usually
divided into departments based on the application
portfolio of the organization, thus allowing easier
specialization and more focused support.

2.4.6.5 Interfaces to other Service Management
Lifecycle stages
There are several other processes that will be executed or
supported during Service Operation, but which are driven
during other phases of the Service Management Lifecycle.
These will be discussed in the final part of Chapter 4 
and include:

■ Change Management, which is a major process that

should be closely linked to Configuration Management
and Release Management. These topics are primarily
covered in the Service Transition publication.

■ Capacity and Availability Management, which are

covered in the Service Design publication.

Service Operation
principles

3 Service Operation principles

When considering Service Operation it is tempting to
focus only on managing day-to-day activities and
technology as ends in themselves. However, Service
Operation exists within a far greater context. As part of the
Service Management Lifecycle, it is responsible for
executing and performing processes that optimize the cost
and quality of services. As part of the organization, it is
responsible for enabling the business to meet its
objectives. As part of the world of technology, it is
responsible for the effective functioning of components
that support services. The principles in this chapter are
aimed at helping Service Operation practitioners to
achieve a balance between all of these roles and to focus
on effectively managing the day-to-day aspects while
maintaining a perspective of the greater context.

3.1 FUNCTIONS, GROUPS, TEAMS,
DEPARTMENTS AND DIVISIONS

The Service Operation publication uses several terms to
refer to the way in which people are organized to execute
processes or activities. There are several published
definitions for each term and it is not the purpose of this
publication to enter the debate about which definition is
best. Please note that the following definitions are generic
and not prescriptive. They are provided simply to define
assumptions and to facilitate understanding of the
material. The reader should adapt these principles to the
organizational practices used in their own organization.

■ Function: A function is a logical concept that refers to

the people and automated measures that execute a
defined process, an activity or a combination of
processes or activities. In larger organizations, a
function may be broken out and performed by several
departments, teams and groups, or it may be
embodied within a single organizational unit (e.g.
Service Desk). In smaller organizations, one person or
group can perform multiple functions – e.g. a
Technical Management department could also
incorporate the Service Desk function.

■ Group: A group is a number of people who are similar

in some way. In this publication, groups refer to
people who perform similar activities – even though
they may work on different technology or report into
different organizational structures or even in different
companies. Groups are usually not formal organization
structures, but are very useful in defining common

processes across the organization – e.g. ensuring that
all people who resolve incidents complete the Incident
Record in the same way. In this publication the term
‘group’ does not refer to a group of companies that
are owned by the same entity.

■ Team: A team is a more formal type of group. These
are people who work together to achieve a common
objective, but not necessarily in the same organization
structure. Team members can be co-located, or work
in multiple different locations and operate virtually.
Teams are useful for collaboration, or for dealing with
a situation of a temporary or transitional nature.
Examples of teams include project teams, application
development teams (often consisting of people from
several different business units) and incident or
problem resolution teams.

■ Department: Departments are formal organization

structures which exist to perform a specific set of
defined activities on an ongoing basis. Departments
have a hierarchical reporting structure with managers
who are usually responsible for the execution of the
activities and also for day-to-day management of the
staff in the department.

■ Division: A division refers to a number of departments
that have been grouped together, often by geography
or product line. A division is normally self-contained
and is able to plan and execute all activities in a
supply chain.

■ Role: A role refers to a set of connected behaviours or
actions that are performed by a person, team or group
in a specific context. For example, a Technical
Management department can perform the role of
Problem Management when diagnosing the root
cause of incidents. This same department could also
be expected to play several other roles at different
times, e.g. it may assess the impact of changes
(Change Management role), manage the performance
of devices under their control (Capacity Management
role), etc. The scope of their role and what triggers
them to play that role are defined by the relevant
process and agreed by their line manager.

3.2 ACHIEVING BALANCE IN SERVICE
OPERATION

Service Operation is more than just the repetitive
execution of a standard set of procedures or activities. All

20

| Service Operation principles

functions, processes and activities are designed to deliver
a specified and agreed level of services, but they have to
be delivered in an ever-changing environment.

This forms a conflict between maintaining the status quo
and adapting to changes in the business and
technological environments. One of Service Operation’s
key roles is therefore to deal with this conflict and to
achieve a balance between conflicting sets of priorities.

This section of the publication highlights some of the key
tensions and conflicts and identifies how IT organizations
can recognize that they are suffering from an imbalance
by tending more towards one extreme or the other. It also
provides some high-level guidelines on how to resolve the
conflict and thus move towards a best-practice approach.
Every conflict therefore represents an opportunity for
growth and improvement.

3.2.1 Internal IT view versus external
business view
The most fundamental conflict in all phases of the ITSM
Lifecycle is between the view of IT as a set of IT services
(the external business view) and the view of IT as a set of
technology components (internal IT view).

■ The external view of IT is the way in which services
are experienced by its users and customers. They do
not always understand, nor do they care about, the
details of what technology is used to manage those
services. All they are concerned about is that the
services are delivered as required and agreed.
■ The internal view of IT is the way in which IT

Both views are necessary when delivering services. The
organization that focuses only on business requirements
without thinking about how they are going to deliver will
end up making promises that cannot be kept. The
organization that focuses only on internal systems without
thinking about what services they support will end up
with expensive services that deliver little value.

The potential for role conflict between the external and
internal views is the result of many variables, including 
the maturity of the organization, its management culture,
its history, etc. This makes a balance difficult to achieve,
and most organizations tend more towards one role 
than the other. Of course, no organization will be 
totally internally or externally focused, but will find itself in
a position along a spectrum between the two. This is
illustrated in Figure 3.1:

components and systems are managed to deliver the
services. Since IT systems are complex and diverse, this
often means that the technology is managed by
several different teams or departments – each of
which is focused on achieving good performance and
availability of ‘its’ systems.

Table 3.1 outlines some examples of the characteristics of
positions at the extreme ends of the spectrum. The
purpose of this table is to assist organizations in
identifying to which extreme they are closer, not to
identify real-life positions to which organizations should
aspire.

22

| Service Operation principles

This does not mean that the external focus is unimportant.
The whole point of Service Management is to provide
services that meet the objectives of the organization as a
whole. It is critical to structure services around customers.
At the same time, it is possible to compromise the 
quality of services by not thinking about how they 
will be delivered.

Building Service Operation with a balance between
internal and external focus requires a long-term, dedicated
approach reflected in all phases of the ITSM Service
Lifecycle. This will require the following:

■ An understanding of what services are used by the

business and why.

■ An understanding of the relative importance and

impact of those services on the business.

■ An understanding of how technology is used to

provide IT services.

■ Involvement of Service Operation in Continual Service

Improvement projects that aim to identify ways of
delivering more, increase service quality and lower
cost.

■ Procedures and manuals that outline the role of IT
Operations in both the management of technology
and the delivery of IT services.

■ A clearly differentiated set of metrics to report to the

business on the achievement of service objectives; and
to report to IT managers on the efficiency and
effectiveness of Service Operation.

■ All IT Operations staff understand exactly how the

performance of the technology affects the delivery of
IT services and in turn how these affect the business
and the business goals.

■ A set of standard services delivered consistently to all
Business Units and a set of non-standard (sometimes
customized) services delivered to specific Business
Units – together with a set of Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs) that can meet both sets of
requirements.

■ A cost strategy aimed at balancing the requirements

of different business units with the cost savings
available through optimization of existing technology
or investment in new technology – and an
understanding of the cost strategy by all involved 
IT resources.

■ A value-based, rather than cost-based, Return on

Investment strategy.

■ Involvement of IT Operations staff in the Service

Design and Service Transition phases of the 
ITSM Lifecycle.

■ Input from and feedback to Continual Service

Improvement to identify areas where there is an
imbalance and the means to identify and enforce
improvement.

■ A clear communication and training plan for business.

While many organizations are good at developing
Communication Plans for projects, this often does not
extend into their operational phase.

3.2.2 Stability versus responsiveness
No matter how good the functionality is of an IT service
and no matter how well it has been designed, it will be
worth far less if the service components are not available
or if they perform inconsistently.

This means that Service Operation needs to ensure that
the IT Infrastructure is stable and available as designed. At
the same time, Service Operation needs to recognize that
business and IT requirements change.

Some of these changes are evolutionary. For example, the
functionality, performance and architecture of a platform
may change over a number of years. Each change brings
with it an opportunity to provide better levels of service to
the business. In evolutionary changes, it is possible to plan
how to respond to the change and thus maintain stability
while responding to the changes.

Many changes, though, happen very quickly and
sometimes under extreme pressure. For example, a
Business Unit unexpectedly wins a contract that requires
additional IT services, more capacity and faster response
times. The ability to respond to this type of change
without impacting other services is a significant challenge.

Many IT organizations are unable to achieve this balance
and tend to focus on either the stability of the IT
Infrastructure or the ability to respond to changes quickly.

Table 3.2 outlines some examples of the characteristics of
positions at extreme ends of the spectrum. The purpose of
this table is to assist organizations in identifying to which
extreme they are closer, not to identify real-life positions
to which organizations should aspire.

Building an IT organization that achieves a balance
between stability and responsiveness in Service Operation
will require the following actions:

■ Ensure investment in technologies and processes that

are adaptive rather than rigid, e.g. virtual server and
application technology and the use of Change Models
(see Service Transition publication).

■ Build a strong Service Level Management (SLM)

process which is active from the Service Design phase
to the Continual Service Improvement phase of the
ITSM Lifecycle.

■ Foster integration between SLM and the other Service

Design processes to ensure proper mapping of
business requirements to IT operational activities and
components of the IT Infrastructure. This makes it
easier to model the effect of changes and
improvements.

■ Initiate changes at the earliest appropriate stage in the

ITSM Lifecycle. This will ensure that both functional
(business) and manageability (IT operational)
requirements can be assessed and built or changed
together.

■ Ensure IT involvement in business changes as early as

possible in the change process to ensure scalability,
consistency and achievability of IT services sustaining
business changes.

■ Service Operation teams should provide input into the

ongoing design and refinement of the architectures
and IT services (see Service Design and Service
Strategy publications).

■ Implement and use SLM to avoid situations where

business and IT managers and staff negotiate informal
agreements.

3.2.3 Quality of service versus cost of
service
Service Operation is required consistently to deliver the
agreed level of IT service to its customers and users, while
at the same time keeping costs and resource utilization at
an optimal level.

(Performance, Availability, Recovery)

Figure 3.3 Balancing service quality and cost

Figure 3.3 represents the investment made to deliver a
service at increasing levels of quality.

In Figure 3.3, an increase in the level of quality usually
results in an increase in the cost of that service, and vice
versa. However, the relationship is not always directly
proportional:

■ Early in the service’s lifecycle it is possible to achieve
significant increases in service quality with a relatively
small amount of money. For example, improving
service availability from 55% to 75% is fairly
straightforward and may not require a huge
investment.

■ Later in the service’s lifecycle, even small

improvements in quality are very expensive. For
example, improving the same service’s availability from
96% to 99.9% may require large investments in high-
availability technology and support staff and tools.

While this may seem straightforward, many organizations
are under severe pressure to increase the quality of service
while reducing their costs. In Figure 3.3, the relationship
between cost and quality is sometimes inverse. It is
possible (usually inside the range of optimization) to
increase quality while reducing costs. This is normally

initiated within Service Operation and carried forward by
Continual Service Improvement. Some costs can be
reduced incrementally over time, but most cost savings
can be made only once. For example, once a duplicate
software tool has been eliminated, it cannot be eliminated
again for further cost savings.

Achieving an optimal balance between cost and quality
(shown between the dotted lines in Figure 3.3) is a key
role of Service Management. There is no industry standard
for what this range should be, since each service will have
a different range of optimization, depending on the nature
of the service and the type of business objective being
met. For example, the business may be prepared to spend
more to achieve high availability on a mission-critical
service, while it is prepared to live with the lower quality
of an administrative tool.

Determining the appropriate balance of cost and quality
should be done during the Service Strategy and Service
Design Lifecycle phases, although in many organizations it
is left to the Service Operation teams – many of whom do
not generally have all the facts or authority to be able to
make this type of decision.

Service Operation principles  |

25

Unfortunately, it is also common to find organizations that
are spending vast quantities of money without achieving
any clear improvements in quality. Again, Continual
Service Improvement will be able to identify the cause of
the inefficiency, evaluate the optimal balance for that
service and formulate a corrective plan.

available, or ‘under sizing’ because the business does not
understand the manageability requirements of the
solution. Either result will cause customer dissatisfaction
and even more expense when the solution is re-
engineered or retro-fitted to the requirements that should
have been specified during Service Design.

Achieving the correct balance is important. Too much
focus on quality will result in IT services that deliver more
than necessary, at a higher cost, and could lead to a
discussion on reducing the price of services. Too much
focus on cost will result in IT delivering on or under
budget, but putting the business at risk through sub-
standard IT services.

Special note: just how far is too much?

Over the past several years, IT organizations have
been under pressure to cut costs. In many cases this
resulted in optimized costs and quality. But, in other
cases, costs were cut to the point where quality
started to suffer. At first, the signs were subtle – small
increases in incident resolution times and a slight
increase in the number of incidents. Over time,
though, the situation became more serious as staff
worked long hours to handle multiple workloads and
services ran on ageing or outdated infrastructure.

There is no simple calculation to determine when
costs have been cut too far, but good SLM is crucial
to making customers aware of the impact of cutting
too far, so recognizing these warning signs and
symptoms can greatly enhance an organization’s
ability to correct this situation.

Service Level Requirements – together with a clear
understanding of the business purpose of the service and
the potential risks – will help to ensure that the service is
delivered at the appropriate cost. They will also help to
avoid ‘over sizing’ of the service just because budget is

Achieving a balance will ensure delivery of the level of
service necessary to meet business requirements at an
optimal (as opposed to lowest possible) cost. This will
require the following:

■ A Financial Management process and tools that can

account for the cost of providing IT services; and
which model alternative methods of delivering services
at differing levels of cost. For example, comparing the

cost of delivering a service at 98% availability or at
99.9% availability; or the cost of providing a service
with or without additional functionality.

■ Ensuring that decisions around cost versus quality are

made by the appropriate managers during Service
Strategy and Service Design. IT operational managers
are generally not equipped to evaluate business
opportunities and should only be asked to make
financial decisions that are related to achieving
operational efficiencies.

3.2.4 Reactive versus proactive
A reactive organization is one which does not act unless it
is prompted to do so by an external driver, e.g. a new
business requirement, an application that has been
developed or escalation in complaints made by users and
customers. An unfortunate reality in many organizations is
the focus on reactive management mistakenly as the sole
means to ensure services that are highly consistent and
stable, actively discouraging proactive behaviour from
operational staff. The unfortunate irony of this approach is
that discouraging effort investment in proactive Service
Management can ultimately increase the effort and cost of
reactive activities and further risk stability and consistency
in services.

A proactive organization is always looking for ways to
improve the current situation. It will continually scan the
internal and external environments, looking for signs of
potentially impacting changes. Proactive behaviour is
usually seen as positive, especially since it enables the
organization to maintain competitive advantage in a
changing environment. However, being too proactive can
be expensive and can result in staff being distracted. The
need for proper balance in reactive and proactive
behaviour often achieves the optimal result.

Generally, it is better to manage IT services proactively, but
achieving this is not easily planned or achieved. This is
because building a proactive IT organization is dependent
on many variables, including:

■ The maturity of the organization. The longer the

organization has been delivering a consistent set of IT
services, the more likely it is to understand the
relationship between IT and the business and the IT
Infrastructure and IT services.

■ The culture of the organization. Some organizations
have a culture that is focused on innovation and are
more likely to be proactive. Others are more likely to
focus on the status quo and as such are likely to resist
change and have more reactive focus.

■ The role that IT plays in the business and the mandate
that IT has to influence the strategy and tactics of the
business. For example, a company where the CIO is a
board member is likely to have an IT organization that
is far more proactive and responsive than a company
where IT is seen as an administrative overhead.

■ The level of integration of management processes and

tools. Higher levels of integration will facilitate better
knowledge of opportunities.

■ The maturity and scope of Knowledge Management in

the organization; this is especially seen in
organizations which have been able to store and
organize historical data effectively – especially
Availability and Problem Management data.

From a maturity perspective, it is clear that newer
organizations will have different priorities and experiences
from a more established organization – what is best
practice for a mature organization may not suit a younger
organization. Therefore an imbalance could result from an
organization being either less or more mature. Consider
the following:

■ Less mature organizations (or organizations with
newer IT services or technology) will generally be
more reactive, simply because they do not know all
the variables involved in running their business and
providing IT services.

■ IT staff in newer organizations tend to be generalists

because it is unclear exactly what is required to deliver
stable IT services to the business.

■ Incidents and problems in newer organizations are

fairly unpredictable because the technology is
relatively new and changes quickly.

■ More mature organizations tend to be more proactive,

simply because they have more data and reporting
available and know the typical patterns of incidents
and workflows. Thus, they forecast exceptions far 
more easily.

■ Staff working in mature organizations also generally
tend to have more established relationships between
IT staff and the business and so can be more proactive
about meeting changing business requirements – this
is especially true when IT is seen as a strategic
component of the business.

While proactive behaviour in Service Operation is generally
good, there are also times where reactive behaviour is
needed. The role of Service Operation is therefore to
achieve a balance between being reactive and proactive.
This will require:

■ Formal Problem Management and Incident

Management processes, integrated between Service
Operation and Continual Service Improvement.

■ The ability to be able to prioritize technical faults as

well as business demands. This needs to be done
during Service Operation, but the mechanisms need to
be put in place during Service Strategy and Design.
These mechanisms could include incident
categorization systems, escalation procedures and
tools to facilitate impact assessment for changes.

■ Data from Configuration and Asset Management to

provide data where required, saving projects time and
making decisions more accurate.

■ Ongoing involvement of SLM in Service Operation.

| Service Operation principles

3.3 PROVIDING SERVICE

All Service Operation staff must be fully aware that they
are there to ‘provide service’ to the business. They must
provide a timely (rapid response and speedy delivery 
of requirements), professional and courteous service to
allow the business to conduct its own activities – so that
the commercial customer’s needs are met and the
business thrives.

It is important that staff are trained not only in how to
deliver and support IT services, but also in the manner in
which that service should be provided. For example, staff
that are capable and deliver service effectively may still
cause significant customer dissatisfaction if they are
insensitive or dismissive. Conversely, no amount of being
nice to a customer will help if the service is not being
delivered.

A critical element of being a proficient service provider is
placing as much emphasis on recruiting and training staff
to develop competency in dealing with and managing
customer relationships and interactions as they do on
technical competencies for managing the IT environment.

3.4 OPERATION STAFF INVOLVEMENT IN
SERVICE DESIGN AND SERVICE TRANSITION

It is extremely important that Service Operation staff are
involved in Service Design and Service Transition and
potentially also in Service Strategy where appropriate.

One key to achieving balance in Service Operation is an
effective set of Service Design processes. These will
provide IT Operations Management with:

■ Clear definition of IT service objectives and

performance criteria

■ Linkage of IT service specifications to the performance

of the IT Infrastructure

■ Definition of operational performance requirements
■ A mapping of services and technology
■ The ability to model the effect of changes in

technology and changes to business requirements
■ Appropriate cost models (e.g. customer or service
based) to evaluate Return on Investment and cost-
reduction strategies.

The nature of IT Operations Management involvement
should be carefully positioned. Service Design is a phase in
the Service Management Lifecycle using a set of processes,
not a function independent of Service Operation. As such,
many of the people who are involved in Service Design
will come from IT Operations Management.

This should not only be encouraged, but Service
Operation staff should be measured on their involvement
in Service Design activities – and such activities should be
included in job descriptions and roles, etc. This will help to
ensure continuity between business requirements and
technology design and operation and it will also help to
ensure that what is designed can also be operated. IT
Operations Management staff should also be involved
during Service Transition to ensure consistency and to
ensure that both stated business and manageability
requirements are met.

Resources must be made available for these activities and
the time required should be taken into account, as
appropriate.

3.5 OPERATIONAL HEALTH

Many organizations find it helpful to compare the
monitoring and control of Service Operation to health
monitoring and control.

In this sense, the IT Infrastructure is like an organism that
has vital life signs that can be monitored to check whether
it is functioning normally. This means that it is not
necessary to monitor continuously every component of
every IT system to ensure that it is functioning.

Operational Health can be determined by isolating a few
important ‘vital signs’ on devices or services that are
defined as critical for the successful execution of a Vital
Business Function. This could be the bandwidth utilization
on a network segment, or memory utilization on a major
server. If these signs are within normal ranges, the system
is healthy and does not require additional attention. 
This reduction in the need for extensive monitoring will
result in cost reduction and operational teams and
departments that are focused on the appropriate areas 
for service success.

However, as with organisms, it is important to check
systems more thoroughly from time to time, to check for
problems that do not immediately affect vital signs. For
example a disk may be functioning perfectly, but it could
be nearing its Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
threshold. In this case the system should be taken out of
service and given a thorough examination or ‘health
check’. At the same time, it should be stressed that the
end result should be the healthy functioning of the service
as a whole. This means that health checks on components
should be balanced against checks of the ‘end-to-end’
service. The definition of what needs to be monitored and
what is healthy versus unhealthy is defined during Service
Design, especially Availability Management and SLM.

Service Operation principles  |

29

Operational Health is dependent on the ability to prevent
incidents and problems by investing in reliable and
maintainable infrastructure. This is achieved through good
availability design and proactive Problem Management. At
the same time, Operational Health is also dependent on
the ability to identify faults and localize them effectively so
that they have minimal impact on the service. This
requires strong (preferably automated) Incident and
Problem Management.

The idea of Operational Health has also led to a
specialized area called ‘Self Healing Systems’. This is an
application of Availability, Capacity, Knowledge, Incident
and Problem Management and refers to a system that has
been designed to withstand the most severe operating
conditions and to detect, diagnose and recover from most
incidents and Known Errors. Self Healing Systems are
known by different names, for example Autonomic
Systems, Adaptive Systems and Dynamic Systems.
Characteristics of Self Healing Systems include:

■ Resilience is designed and built into the system, for

example multiple redundant disks or multiple
processors. This protects the system against hardware
failure since it is able to continue operating using the
duplicated hardware component.

■ Software, data and operating system resilience is also

designed into the system, for example mirrored
databases (where a database is duplicated on a
backup device) and disk-striping technology (where
individual bits of data are distributed across a disk
array – so that a disk failure results in the loss of only
a part of data, which can be easily recovered using
algorithms).

■ The ability to shift processing from one physical
device to another without any disruption to the
service. This could be a response to a failure or
because the device is reaching high utilization levels
(some systems are designed to distribute processing
workloads continuously, to make optimum use of
available capacity, which is also known as
virtualization).

■ Built-in monitoring utilities which enable the system to

detect events and to determine whether these
represent normal operations or not.

■ A correlation engine (see paragraph 4.1.5.6 on Event

Management). This will enable the system to
determine the significance of each event and also to
determine whether there is any predefined response
to that event.

■ A set of diagnostic tools, such as diagnostic scripts,

common workarounds. These are used as soon as an
error is detected, to determine the appropriate
response.

■ The ability to generate a call for human intervention

by raising an alert or generating an incident.

While the concept of Operational Health is not a core
concept of Service Operation, it is often a helpful
metaphor to assist in determining what needs to be
monitored and how frequently to perform preventive
maintenance.

What and when to monitor for operational health should
be determined in Service Design, tested and refined
during Service Transition and optimized in Continual
Service Improvement, as necessary.

3.6 COMMUNICATION

Good communication is needed with other IT teams and
departments, with users and internal customers, and
between the Service Operation teams and departments
themselves. Issues can often be prevented or mitigated
with appropriate communication.

This section is aimed at summarizing the communication
that should take place in Service Operation. This is not a
separate process, but a checklist of the type of
communication that is required for effective Service
Operation.

An important principle is that all communication must
have an intended purpose or a resultant action.
Information should not be communicated unless there is a
clear audience. In addition, that audience should have
been actively involved in determining the need for that
communication and what they will do with the
information.

A detailed description of the types of communication
typical in Service Operation is contained in Appendix B of
this publication, together with a description of the typical
audience and the actions that are intended to be taken as
a result of each communication. These include:

■ Routine operational communication
■ Communication between shifts
■ Performance reporting
■ Communication in projects
■ Communication related to changes
■ Communication related to exceptions
■ Communication related to emergencies
■ Training on new or customized processes and 

fault trees and a database of Known Errors and

service designs

30

| Service Operation principles

■ Communication of strategy and design to Service

Operation teams.

Please note that there is no definitive medium for
communication, nor is there a fixed location or frequency.
In some organizations communication has to take place in
meetings. Other organizations prefer to use e-mail or the
communication inherent in their Service Management
tools.

There should therefore be a policy around communication
within each team or department and for each process.
Although this should be formal, the policy should not be
cumbersome or complex. For example, a manager might
require that all communications regarding changes must
be sent by e-mail. As long as this is specified in the
department’s SOPs (in whatever form they exist), there is
no need to create a separate policy for it.

Although the typical content of communication is fairly
consistent once processes have been defined, the means
of communication are changing with every new
introduction of technology. The list of alternatives is
growing and, today, includes:

■ E-mail, to traditional clients or mobile devices
■ SMS messages
■ Pagers
■ Instant messaging and web-based ‘chats’
■ Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) utilities that can

turn any connected device to an inexpensive
communication medium

■ Teleconference and virtual meeting utilities, which
have revolutionized meetings, which are now held
across long distances

■ Document-sharing utilities.

The means of communication itself is outside the scope of
this publication. However, the following points should be
noted:

■ Communication is primary and the means of

communication must ensure that they serve this goal.
For example, the need for secure communication may
eliminate the possibility of some of the above means.
The need for quality may eliminate some VoIP options.

■ It is possible to use any means of communication as

long as all stakeholders understand how and when
the communication will take place.

3.6.1 Meetings
Different organizations communicate in different ways.
Where organizations are distributed, they will tend to rely
on e-mail and teleconferencing facilities. Organizations

that have more mature Service Management processes
and tools will tend to rely on the tools and processes for
communication (e.g. using an Incident Management tool
to escalate and track incidents, instead of requesting e-
mail or telephone calls for updates).

Other organizations prefer to communicate using
meetings. However, it is important not to get into the
mode whereby the only time work is done, or
management is involved, is during a meeting. Also, face-
to-face meetings tend to increase costs (e.g. travel, time
spent in informal discussions, refreshments, etc.), so
meeting organizers should balance the value of the
meeting with the number and identity of the attendees
and the time they will spend in, and getting to, the
meeting.

The purpose of meetings is to communicate effectively to
a group of people about a common set of objectives or
activities. Meetings should be well controlled and brief,
and the focus should be on facilitating action. A good rule
is not to hold a meeting if the information can be
communicated effectively by automated means.

A number of factors are essential for successful meetings.
Although these may seem to be common sense, they are
sometimes neglected:

■ Establish and communicate a clear agenda to ensure

that the meeting achieves its objective and to help the
facilitator prevent attendees from ‘hijacking’ the
meeting.

■ Ensure that the rules for participating are understood.

Organizations tend to have a formal set of meeting
rules, ranging from relatively informal to very formal
(e.g. Roberts Rules of Order).

■ Make use of ‘parking lots’ or notes that record issues

that are not directly relevant to the purpose of the
meeting, but which can be called on if the need for
discussion arises.

■ Minutes of the meeting: rules should be set about

when minutes are taken. Minutes are used to remind
people who are assigned actions and to track the
progress of delegated actions. They are also useful in
ensuring that cross-functional decisions and actions
are tracked and followed through.

■ Use techniques to encourage the appropriate level of

participation. One technique when discussing
improvements, for example, is the ‘keep, stop, start’
technique. Participants are encouraged to list items
that they would like to keep, things that need to be
stopped and initiatives or actions that they would like
to see started.

Service Operation principles  |

31

Examples of typical meetings are given below:

3.6.1.1 The Operations meeting
Operations meetings are normally held between the
managers of the IT operational departments, teams or
groups, at the beginning of each business day or week.
The purpose of this type of meeting is to make staff aware
of any issue relevant to Operations (such as change
schedules, business events, maintenance schedules, etc.)
and to provide an opportunity for staff to raise any issues
of which they are aware. This is an opportunity to ensure
that all departments in a data centre are synchronized.

In geographically dispersed organizations it may not be
possible to have a single daily Operations meeting. In
these cases it is important to coordinate the agenda of the
meetings and to ensure that each meeting has two
components:

1 The first part of the meeting will cover aspects that

apply to the organization as a whole, e.g. new
policies, changes that affect all regions and business
events that span all regions.

2 The second part of the meeting will cover aspects that

apply only to the local region, e.g. local operations
schedules, changes to local equipment, etc.

The Operations meeting is usually chaired by the IT
Operations Manager or a senior Operations Manager and
attended by all managers and supervisors (except those
whose shifts are not on duty). It is also helpful to have at
least one representative from the Service Desk at the
meeting so that they are aware of any situations that
could give rise to incidents.

Opportunities to improve services or processes should be
captured, if raised, and forwarded to the team responsible
for Continual Service Improvement.

3.6.1.2 Department, group or team meetings
These meetings are essentially the same as the Operations
meeting, but are aimed at a single IT department, group
or team. Each manager or supervisor relays the
information from the Operations meeting that is relevant
to their team.

Additionally, these meetings will also cover the following:

■ A more detailed discussion of incidents, problems and

changes that are still being worked on, with
information about:
● Progress to date
● Confirmation of what still needs to be done
● Estimated completion times

● Request for additional resources, if required
● Discussion of potential problems or concerns
■ Confirmation of staff availability for roster duties
■ Confirmation of vacation schedules.

3.6.1.3 Customer meetings
From time to time it will be necessary to hold meetings
with customers, apart from the regular Service Level
Review meetings. Examples include:

■ Follow-up after serious incidents. The purpose of these

meetings is to repair the relationship with the
customers, but also to ensure that IT has all the
information required to prevent recurrence. Customers
also have the opportunity to provide information
about unforeseen business impacts. These meetings
are helpful in agreeing actions for similar types of
incident that may occur in future.

■ A customer forum, which can be used for a range of
purposes, including testing ideas for new services or
solutions, or gathering requirements for new or
revised services or procedures. A customer forum is
generally a regular meeting with customers to discuss
areas of common concern.

3.7 DOCUMENTATION

IT Operations Management and all of the Technical and
Application Management teams and departments are
involved in creating and maintaining a range of
documents. These are detailed in Chapters 4, 5 and 6 of
this publication and include the following:

■ Participation in the definition and maintenance of

process manuals for all processes they are involved in.
These will include processes in other phases of the IT
Service Management Lifecycle (e.g. Capacity
Management, Change Management, Availability
Management) as well as for all processes included in
the Service Operation phase.

■ Establishing their own technical procedures manuals.

These must be kept up to date and new material must
be added as it becomes relevant, under Change
Control. It should be remembered that their
procedures should always be structured to meet the
objectives and constraints defined within higher-level
Service Management processes, such as SLM. For
example, a technical procedure for managing servers
should always ensure that it aims at achieving the
availability and performance levels agreed to in the
Operational Level Agreements and Service Level
Agreements (SLAs).

32

| Service Operation principles

■ Participation in the creation and maintenance of

planning documents, e.g. the Capacity and Availability
Plans and the IT Service Continuity Plans.

■ Participation in the creation and maintenance of the

Service Portfolio. This will include quantifying costs
and establishing the operational feasibility of each
proposed service.

■ Participation in the definition and maintenance of

Service Management tool work instructions in order to
meet reporting requirements.

4 Service Operation processes

The processes listed in paragraph 2.4.5 are discussed in
detail in this chapter. As a reference, the overall structure
is briefly described here and then each of the processes is
described in more detail later in the chapter. Please note
that the roles for each process and the tools used for each
process are described in Chapters 6 and 7 respectively.

■ Event Management is the process that monitors all

events that occur through the IT infrastructure to allow
for normal operation and also to detect and escalate
exception conditions.

■ Incident Management concentrates on restoring the

service to users as quickly as possible, in order to
minimize business impact.

■ Problem Management involves root-cause analysis to

determine and resolve the cause of events and
incidents, proactive activities to detect and prevent
future problems/incidents and a Known Error sub-
process to allow quicker diagnosis and resolution if
further incidents do occur.

NOTE: Without this distinction between incidents and
problems, and keeping separate Incident and Problem
Records, there is a danger that either:
● Incidents will be closed too early in the overall

support cycle and there will be no actions taken to
prevent recurrence – so the same incidents will
have to be fixed over and over again, or

● Incidents will be kept open so that root cause

analysis can be done and visibility will be lost of
when the user’s service was actually restored – so
SLA targets may not be met even though the
service has been restored within users’
expectations. This often results in a large number
of open incidents, many of which will never be
closed unless a periodic ‘purge’ is undertaken. This
can be very demotivating and can prevent effective
visibility of current issues.

■ Request Fulfilment involves the management of

customer or user requests that are not generated as
an incident from an unexpected service delay or
disruption. Some organizations may choose to handle
such requests as a ‘category’ of incidents and manage
the information through an Incident Management
system – but others may choose (because of high
volumes or business priority of such requests) to
facilitate the provision of Request Fulfilment
capabilities separately via the Request Fulfilment
process. It has become popular practice to use a

formal Request Fulfilment process to manage
customer and user requests for all types of requests
which include facilities, moves and supplies as well as
those specific to IT services. These requests are not
generally tied to the same SLA measures and
separating the records and the process flow is
emerging as best practice in many organizations.

■ Access Management: this is the process of granting

authorized users the right to use a service, while
restricting access to non-authorized users. It is based
on being able accurately to identify authorized users
and then manage their ability to access services as
required during different stages of their human
resources (HR) or contractual lifecycle. Access
Management has also been called Identity or Rights
Management in some organizations.

In addition, there are several other processes that will be
executed or supported during Service Operation, but
which are driven during other phases of the Service
Management Lifecycle. The operational aspects of these
processes will be discussed in the final part of this chapter
and include:

■ Change Management, a major process which should
be closely linked to Configuration Management and
Release Management. These topics are primarily
covered in the Service Transition publication.

■ Capacity and Availability Management, the operational

aspects of which are covered in this publication, but
which are covered in more detail in the Service Design
publication.

■ Financial Management, which is covered in the Service

Strategy publication.

■ Knowledge Management, which is covered in the

Service Transition publication.

■ IT Service Continuity, which is covered in the Service

Design publication.

■ Service Reporting and Measurement, which are
covered in the Continual Service Improvement
publication.

4.1 EVENT MANAGEMENT

An event can be defined as any detectable or discernible
occurrence that has significance for the management of
the IT Infrastructure or the delivery of IT service and
evaluation of the impact a deviation might cause to the

36

| Service Operation processes

services. Events are typically notifications created by an IT
service, Configuration Item (CI) or monitoring tool.

Effective Service Operation is dependent on knowing the
status of the infrastructure and detecting any deviation
from normal or expected operation. This is provided by
good monitoring and control systems, which are based on
two types of tools:

■ active monitoring tools that poll key CIs to determine

their status and availability. Any exceptions will
generate an alert that needs to be communicated to
the appropriate tool or team for action

■ passive monitoring tools that detect and correlate
operational alerts or communications generated by
CIs.

4.1.1 Purpose/goal/objective
The ability to detect events, make sense of them and
determine the appropriate control action is provided by
Event Management. Event Management is therefore the
basis for Operational Monitoring and Control (see
Appendix B).

In addition, if these events are programmed to
communicate operational information as well as warnings
and exceptions, they can be used as a basis for
automating many routine Operations Management
activities, for example executing scripts on remote devices,
or submitting jobs for processing, or even dynamically
balancing the demand for a service across multiple devices
to enhance performance.

Event Management therefore provides the entry point for
the execution of many Service Operation processes and
activities. In addition, it provides a way of comparing
actual performance and behaviour against design
standards and SLAs. As such, Event Management also
provides a basis for Service Assurance and Reporting; and
Service Improvement. This is covered in detail in the
Continual Service Improvement publication.

4.1.2 Scope
Event Management can be applied to any aspect of
Service Management that needs to be controlled and
which can be automated. These include:

■ Configuration Items:

● Some CIs will be included because they need to

stay in a constant state (e.g. a switch on a network
needs to stay on and Event Management tools
confirm this by monitoring responses to ‘pings’).

● Some CIs will be included because their status

needs to change frequently and Event
Management can be used to automate this and
update the CMS (e.g. the updating of a file server).

■ Environmental conditions (e.g. fire and smoke

detection)

■ Software licence monitoring for usage to ensure
optimum/legal licence utilization and allocation

■ Security (e.g. intrusion detection)
■ Normal activity (e.g. tracking the use of an application

or the performance of a server).

The difference between monitoring and Event
Management

These two areas are very closely related, but slightly
different in nature. Event Management is focused on
generating and detecting meaningful notifications
about the status of the IT Infrastructure and services.

While it is true that monitoring is required to detect
and track these notifications, monitoring is broader
than Event Management. For example, monitoring
tools will check the status of a device to ensure that
it is operating within acceptable limits, even if that
device is not generating events.

Put more simply, Event Management works with
occurrences that are specifically generated to be
monitored. Monitoring tracks these occurrences, but
it will also actively seek out conditions that do not
generate events.

4.1.3 Value to business
Event Management’s value to the business is generally
indirect; however, it is possible to determine the basis for
its value as follows:

■ Event Management provides mechanisms for early

detection of incidents. In many cases it is possible for
the incident to be detected and assigned to the

Service Operation processes  |

37

appropriate group for action before any actual service
outage occurs.

■ Event Management makes it possible for some types
of automated activity to be monitored by exception –
thus removing the need for expensive and resource
intensive real-time monitoring, while reducing
downtime.

■ When integrated into other Service Management

processes (such as, for example, Availability or Capacity
Management), Event Management can signal status
changes or exceptions that allow the appropriate
person or team to perform early response, thus
improving the performance of the process. This, in
turn, will allow the business to benefit from more
effective and more efficient Service Management
overall.

■ Event Management provides a basis for automated
operations, thus increasing efficiencies and allowing
expensive human resources to be used for more
innovative work, such as designing new or improved
functionality or defining new ways in which the
business can exploit technology for increased
competitive advantage.

4.1.4 Policies/principles/basic concepts
There are many different types of events, for example:

■ Events that signify regular operation:

● notification that a scheduled workload has

completed

● a user has logged in to use an application
● an e-mail has reached its intended recipient.

■ Events that signify an exception

alert indicates that a payment authorization site is
unavailable – impacting financial approval of
business transactions)

● a device’s CPU is above the acceptable utilization

rate

● a PC scan reveals the installation of unauthorized

software.

■ Events that signify unusual, but not exceptional,

operation. These are an indication that the situation
may require closer monitoring. In some cases the
condition will resolve itself, for example in the case of
an unusual combination of workloads – as they are
completed, normal operation is restored. In other
cases, operator intervention may be required if the
situation is repeated or if it continues for too long.
These rules or policies are defined in the Monitoring
and Control Objectives for that device or service.
Examples of this type of event are:
● A server’s memory utilization reaches within 5% of

its highest acceptable performance level

● The completion time of a transaction is 10% longer

than normal.

Two things are significant about the above examples:

■ Exactly what constitutes normal versus unusual

operation, versus an exception? There is no definitive
rule about this. For example, a manufacturer may
provide that a benchmark of 75% memory utilization
is optimal for application X. However, it is discovered
that, under the specific conditions of our organization,
response times begin to degrade above 70%
utilization. The next section will explore how these
figures are determined.

● a user attempts to log on to an application with

■ Each relies on the sending and receipt of a message

the incorrect password

● an unusual situation has occurred in a business

process that may indicate an exception requiring
further business investigation (e.g. a web page

of some type. These are generally referred to as Event
notifications and they don’t just happen. The next
paragraphs will explore exactly how events are
defined, generated and captured.

4.1.5 Process activities, methods and
techniques
Figure 4.1 is a high-level and generic representation of
Event Management. It should be used as a reference and
definition point, rather than an actual Event Management
flowchart. Each activity in this process is described below.

4.1.5.1 Event occurs
Events occur continuously, but not all of them are
detected or registered. It is therefore important that
everybody involved in designing, developing, managing
and supporting IT services and the IT Infrastructure 
that they run on understands what types of event need 
to be detected.

This is discussed in paragraph 4.1.10.1, titled
‘Instrumentation’.

4.1.5.2 Event notification
Most CIs are designed to communicate certain information
about themselves in one of two ways:

■ A device is interrogated by a management tool, which
collects certain targeted data. This is often referred to
as polling.

■ The CI generates a notification when certain

conditions are met. The ability to produce these
notifications has to be designed and built into 
the CI, for example a programming hook inserted 
into an application.

Event notifications can be proprietary, in which case only
the manufacturer’s management tools can be used to
detect events. Most CIs, however, generate Event
notifications using an open standard such as SNMP
(Simple Network Management Protocol).

Many CIs are configured to generate a standard set of
events, based on the designer’s experience of what is
required to operate the CI, with the ability to generate
additional types of event by ‘turning on’ the relevant
event generation mechanism. For other CI types, some
form of ‘agent’ software will have to be installed in order
to initiate the monitoring. Often this monitoring feature 
is free, but sometimes there is a cost to the licensing 
of the tool.

In an ideal world, the Service Design process should define
which events need to be generated and then specify how
this can be done for each type of CI. During Service
Transition, the event generation options would be set 
and tested.

In many organizations, however, defining which events to
generate is done by trial and error. System managers use
the standard set of events as a starting point and then
tune the CI over time, to include or exclude events as
required. The problem with this approach is that it only
takes into account the immediate needs of the staff
managing the device and does not facilitate good
planning or improvement. In addition, it makes it very
difficult to monitor and manage the service over all
devices and staff. One approach to combating this
problem is to review the set of events as part of continual
improvement activities.

A general principle of Event notification is that the more
meaningful the data it contains and the more targeted the
audience, the easier it is to make decisions about the
event. Operators are often confronted by coded error
messages and have no idea how to respond to them or
what to do with them. Meaningful notification data and
clearly defined roles and responsibilities need to be
articulated and documented during Service Design and
Service Transition (see also paragraph 4.1.10.1 on
‘Instrumentation’). If roles and responsibilities are not
clearly defined, in a wide alert, no one knows who is
doing what and this can lead to things being missed or
duplicated efforts.

4.1.5.3 Event detection
Once an Event notification has been generated, it will be
detected by an agent running on the same system, or
transmitted directly to a management tool specifically
designed to read and interpret the meaning of the event.

4.1.5.4 Event filtering
The purpose of filtering is to decide whether to
communicate the event to a management tool or to
ignore it. If ignored, the event will usually be recorded in a
log file on the device, but no further action will be taken.

The reason for filtering is that it is not always possible to
turn Event notification off, even though a decision has
been made that it is not necessary to generate that type
of event. It may also be decided that only the first in a
series of repeated Event notifications will be transmitted.

During the filtering step, the first level of correlation is
performed, i.e. the determination of whether the event is
informational, a warning, or an exception (see next step).
This correlation is usually done by an agent that resides on
the CI or on a server to which the CI is connected.

The filtering step is not always necessary. For some CIs,
every event is significant and moves directly into a
management tool’s correlation engine, even if it is

40

| Service Operation processes

duplicated. Also, it may have been possible to turn off all
unwanted Event notifications.

4.1.5.5 Significance of events
Every organization will have its own categorization of the
significance of an event, but it is suggested that at least
these three broad categories be represented:

■ Informational: This refers to an event that does not

require any action and does not represent an
exception. They are typically stored in the system or
service log files and kept for a predetermined period.
Informational events are typically used to check on the
status of a device or service, or to confirm the
successful completion of an activity. Informational
events can also be used to generate statistics (such as
the number of users logged on to an application
during a certain period) and as input into
investigations (such as which jobs completed
successfully before the transaction processing queue
hung). Examples of informational events include:
● A user logs onto an application
● A job in the batch queue completes successfully
● A device has come online
● A transaction is completed successfully.

■ Warning: A warning is an event that is generated

when a service or device is approaching a threshold.
Warnings are intended to notify the appropriate
person, process or tool so that the situation can be
checked and the appropriate action taken to prevent
an exception. Warnings are not typically raised for a
device failure. Although there is some debate about
whether the failure of a redundant device is a warning
or an exception (since the service is still available). A
good rule is that every failure should be treated as an
exception, since the risk of an incident impacting the
business is much greater. Examples of warnings are:
● Memory utilization on a server is currently at 65%

and increasing. If it reaches 75%, response times
will be unacceptably long and the OLA for that
department will be breached.

● The collision rate on a network has increased by

15% over the past hour.

an exception could be generated when an
unauthorized device is discovered on the network.
This can be managed by using either an Incident
Record or a Request for Change (or even both),
depending on the organization’s Incident and Change
Management policies. Examples of exceptions include:
● A server is down
● Response time of a standard transaction across the

network has slowed to more than 15 seconds

● More than 150 users have logged on to the

General Ledger application concurrently

● A segment of the network is not responding to

routine requests.

4.1.5.6 Event correlation
If an event is significant, a decision has to be made about
exactly what the significance is and what actions need to
be taken to deal with it. It is here that the meaning of the
event is determined.

Correlation is normally done by a ‘Correlation Engine’,
usually part of a management tool that compares the
event with a set of criteria and rules in a prescribed order.
These criteria are often called Business Rules, although
they are generally fairly technical. The idea is that the
event may represent some impact on the business and the
rules can be used to determine the level and type of
business impact.

A Correlation Engine is programmed according to the
performance standards created during Service Design and
any additional guidance specific to the operating
environment.

Examples of what Correlation Engines will take into
account include:

■ Number of similar events (e.g. this is the third time
that the same user has logged in with the incorrect
password, a business application reports that there has
been an unusual pattern of usage of a mobile
telephone that could indicate that the device has
been lost or stolen)

■ Number of CIs generating similar events
■ Whether a specific action is associated with the code

■ Exception: An exception means that a service or

or data in the event

device is currently operating abnormally (however that
has been defined). Typically, this means that an OLA
and SLA have been breached and the business is
being impacted. Exceptions could represent a total
failure, impaired functionality or degraded
performance. Please note, though, that an exception
does not always represent an incident. For example,

■ Whether the event represents an exception
■ A comparison of utilization information in the event
with a maximum or minimum standard (e.g. has the
device exceeded a threshold?)

■ Whether additional data is required to investigate the

event further, and possibly even a collection of that
data by polling another system or database

Service Operation processes  |

41

■ Categorization of the event
■ Assigning a priority level to the event.

4.1.5.7 Trigger
If the correlation activity recognizes an event, a response
will be required. The mechanism used to initiate that
response is called a trigger.

There are many different types of triggers, each designed
specifically for the task it has to initiate. Some examples
include:

■ Incident Triggers that generate a record in the Incident

Management system, thus initiating the Incident
Management process

■ Change Triggers that generate a Request for Change

(RFC), thus initiating the Change Management process
■ A trigger resulting from a approved RFC that has been

implemented but caused the event, or from an
unauthorised change that has been detected – in
either case this will be referred to Change
Management for investigation

■ Scripts that execute specific actions, such as
submitting batch jobs or rebooting a device

■ Paging systems that will notify a person or team of

the event by mobile phone

■ Database triggers that restrict access of a user to
specific records or fields, or that create or delete
entries in the database.

4.1.5.8 Response selection
At this point in the process, there are a number of
response options available. It is important to note that the
response options can be chosen in any combination. For
example, it may be necessary to preserve the log entry for
future reference, but at the same time escalate the event
to an Operations Management staff member for action.

The options in the flowchart are examples. Different
organizations will have different options, and they are sure
to be more detailed. For example, there will be a range of
auto responses for each different technology. The process
of determining which one is appropriate and how to
execute it are not represented in this flowchart. Some of
the options available are:

■ Event logged: Regardless of what activity is

performed, it is a good idea to have a record of the
event and any subsequent actions. The event can be
logged as an Event Record in the Event Management
tool, or it can simply be left as an entry in the system
log of the device or application that generated the
event. If this is the case, though, there needs to be a

standing order for the appropriate Operations
Management staff to check the logs on a regular basis
and clear instructions about how to use each log. It
should also be remembered that the event
information in the logs may not be meaningful until
an incident occurs; and where the Technical
Management staff use the logs to investigate where
the incident originated. This means that the Event
Management procedures for each system or team
need to define standards about how long events are
kept in the logs before being archived and deleted.

■ Auto response: Some events are understood well
enough that the appropriate response has already
been defined and automated. This is normally as a
result of good design or of previous experience
(usually Problem Management). The trigger will initiate
the action and then evaluate whether it was
completed successfully. If not, an Incident or 
Problem Record will be created. Examples of auto
responses include:
● Rebooting a device
● Restarting a service
● Submitting a job into batch
● Changing a parameter on a device
● Locking a device or application to protect it

against unauthorized access.

Note: locking a device may result in denial of service
to authorized users, which could be exploited by a
deliberate attacker – so great care should be taken
when deciding whether this is an appropriate
automated action. Where this response is used it may
be prudent to also combine this with a call for human
intervention, so that the automated action can be
swiftly checked and approved.

■ Alert and human intervention: If the event requires
human intervention, it will need to be escalated. The
purpose of the alert is to ensure that the person with
the skills appropriate to deal with the event is notified.
The alert will contain all the information necessary for
that person to determine the appropriate action –
including reference to any documentation required
(e.g. user manuals). It is important to note that this is
not necessarily the same as the functional escalation
of an incident, where the emphasis is on restoring
service within an agreed time (which may require a
variety of activities). The alert requires a person, or
team, to perform a specific action, possibly on a
specific device and possibly at a specific time, e.g.
changing a toner cartridge in a printer when the level
is low.

represent a situation where the appropriate response
will need to be handled through the Incident, Problem
or Change Management process. These are discussed
below, but it is important to note that a single
incident may initiate any one or a combination of
these three processes – for example, a non-critical
server failure is logged as an incident, but as there is
no workaround, a Problem Record is created to
determine the root cause and resolution and an RFC is
logged to relocate the workload onto an alternative
server while the problem is resolved.

■ Open an RFC: There are two places in the Event

Management process where an RFC can be created:
● When an exception occurs: For example, a scan

of a network segment reveals that two new
devices have been added without the necessary
authorization. A way of dealing with this situation
is to open an RFC, which can be used as a vehicle
for the Change Management process to deal with
the exception (as an alternative to the more
conventional approach of opening an incident that
would be routed via the Service Desk to Change
Management). Investigation by Change
Management is appropriate here since
unauthorized changes imply that the Change
Management process was not effective.

Problem Record to be opened without related
incidents (for example as a result of a Service Failure
Analysis (see Service Design publication) or maturity
assessment, or because of a high number of retry
network errors, even though a failure has not yet
occurred). In most cases this step refers to linking an
incident to an existing Problem Record. This will assist
the Problem Management teams to reassess the
severity and impact of the problem, and may result in
a changed priority to an outstanding problem.
However, it is possible, with some of the more
sophisticated tools, to evaluate the impact of the
incidents and also to raise a Problem Record
automatically, where this is warranted, to allow root-
cause analysis to commence immediately.

■ Special types of incident: In some cases an event

will indicate an exception that does not directly
impact any IT service, for example, a redundant air
conditioning unit fails, or unauthorized entry to a data
centre. Guidelines for these events are as follows:
● An incident should be logged using an Incident

Model that is appropriate for that type of
exception, e.g. an Operations Incident or Security
Incident (see paragraph 4.2.4.2 for more details of
Incident Models).

● The incident should be escalated to the group that

● Correlation identifies that a change is needed:

manages that type of incident.

In this case the event correlation activity
determines that the appropriate response to an
event is for something to be changed. For
example, a performance threshold has been
reached and a parameter on a major server needs
to be tuned. How does the correlation activity
determine this? It was programmed to do so either
in the Service Design process or because this has
happened before and Problem Management or
Operations Management updated the Correlation
Engine to take this action.

■ Open an Incident Record: As with an RFC, an

incident can be generated immediately when an
exception is detected, or when the Correlation Engine
determines that a specific type or combination of
events represents an incident. When an Incident
Record is opened, as much information as possible
should be included – with links to the events
concerned and if possible a completed diagnostic
script.

● As there is no outage, the Incident Model used
should reflect that this was an operational issue
rather than a service issue. The statistics would not
normally be reported to customers or users, unless
they can be used to demonstrate that the money
invested in redundancy was a good investment.
● These incidents should not be used to calculate

downtime, and can in fact be used to demonstrate
how proactive IT has been in making services
available.

4.1.5.9 Review actions
With thousands of events being generated every day, it is
not possible formally to review every individual event.
However, it is important to check that any significant
events or exceptions have been handled appropriately, or
to track trends or counts of event types, etc. In many cases
this can be done automatically, for example polling a
server that had been rebooted using an automated script
to see that it is functioning correctly.

In the cases where events have initiated an incident,
problem and/or change, the Action Review should not
duplicate any reviews that have been done as part of

those processes. Rather, the intention is to ensure that the
handover between the Event Management process and
other processes took place as designed and that the
expected action did indeed take place. This will ensure
that incidents, problems or changes originating within
Operations Management do not get lost between the
teams or departments.

The Review will also be used as input into continual
improvement and the evaluation and audit of the Event
Management process.

4.1.5.10 Close event
Some events will remain open until a certain action takes
place, for example an event that is linked to an open
incident. However, most events are not ‘opened’ 
or ‘closed’.

Informational events are simply logged and then used as
input to other processes, such as Backup and Storage
Management. Auto-response events will typically be closed
by the generation of a second event. For example, a
device generates an event and is rebooted through auto
response – as soon as that device is successfully back
online, it generates an event that effectively closes the
loop and clears the first event.

It is sometimes very difficult to relate the open event and
the close notifications as they are in different formats. It is
optimal that devices in the infrastructure produce ‘open’
and ‘close’ events in the same format and specify the
change of status. This allows the correlation step in the
process to easily match open and close notifications.

In the case of events that generated an incident, problem
or change, these should be formally closed with a link to
the appropriate record from the other process.

4.1.6 Triggers, input and output/inter-
process interfaces
Event Management can be initiated by any type of
occurrence. The key is to define which of these
occurrences is significant and which need to be acted
upon. Triggers include:

■ Exceptions to any level of CI performance defined in

the design specifications, OLAs or SOPs

■ Exceptions to an automated procedure or process, e.g.

a routine change that has been assigned to a build
team has not been completed in time

■ An exception within a business process that is being

monitored by Event Management

■ The completion of an automated task or job
■ A status change in a device or database record

Service Operation processes  |

43

■ Access of an application or database by a user or

automated procedure or job

■ A situation where a device, database or application,

etc. has reached a predefined threshold of
performance.

Event Management can interface to any process that
requires monitoring and control, especially those that do
not require real-time monitoring, but which do require
some form of intervention following an event or group of
events. Examples of interfaces with other processes
include:

■ Interface with business applications and/or business

processes to allow potentially significant business
events to be detected and acted upon (e.g. a business
application reports abnormal activity on a customer’s
account that may indicate some sort of fraud or
security breach).

■ The primary ITSM relationships are with Incident,

Problem and Change Management. These interfaces
are described in some detail in paragraph 4.1.5.8.

■ Capacity and Availability Management are critical in

defining what events are significant, what appropriate
thresholds should be and how to respond to them. In
return, Event Management will improve the
performance and availability of services by responding
to events when they occur and by reporting on actual
events and patterns of events to determine (by
comparison with SLA targets and KPIs) if there is some
aspect of the infrastructure design or operation that
can be improved.

■ Configuration Management is able to use events to

determine the current status of any CI in the
infrastructure. Comparing events with the authorized
baselines in the Configuration Management System
(CMS) will help to determine whether there is
unauthorized Change activity taking place in the
organization (see Service Transition publication).

■ Asset Management (covered in more detail in the

Service Design and Transition publications) can use
Event Management to determine the lifecycle status of
assets. For example, an event could be generated to
signal that a new asset has been successfully
configured and is now operational.

■ Events can be a rich source of information that can be

processed for inclusion in Knowledge Management
systems. For example, patterns of performance can be
correlated with business activity and used as input
into future design and strategy decisions.

44

| Service Operation processes

■ Event Management can play an important role in
ensuring that potential impact on SLAs is detected
early and any failures are rectified as soon as possible
so that impact on service targets is minimized.

4.1.7 Information Management
Key information involved in Event Management includes
the following:

■ SNMP messages, which are a standard way of

communicating technical information about the status
of components of an IT Infrastructure.

■ Management Information Bases (MIBs) of IT devices.
An MIB is the database on each device that contains
information about that device, including its operating
system, BIOS version, configuration of system
parameters, etc. The ability to interrogate MIBs and
compare them to a norm is critical to being able to
generate events.

■ Vendor’s monitoring tools agent software.
■ Correlation Engines contain detailed rules to

determine the significance and appropriate response
to events. Details on this are provided in paragraph
4.1.5.6.

■ There is no standard Event Record for all types of

event. The exact contents and format of the record
depend on the tools being used, what is being
monitored (e.g. a server and the Change Management
tools will have very different data and probably use a
different format). However, there is some key data that
is usually required from each event to be useful in
analysis. It should typically include the:
● Device
● Component
● Type of failure
● Date/time
● Parameters in exception
● Value.

4.1.8 Metrics
For each measurement period in question, the metrics to
check on the effectiveness and efficiency of the Event
Management process should include the following:

■ Number of events by category
■ Number of events by significance
■ Number and percentage of events that required

human intervention and whether this was performed

■ Number and percentage of events that resulted in

incidents or changes

■ Number and percentage of events caused by existing

problems or Known Errors. This may result in a change
to the priority of work on that problem or Known
Error

■ Number and percentage of repeated or duplicated

events. This will help in the tuning of the Correlation
Engine to eliminate unnecessary event generation and
can also be used to assist in the design of better
event generation functionality in new services
■ Number and percentage of events indicating

performance issues (for example, growth in the
number of times an application exceeded its
transaction thresholds over the past six months)

■ Number and percentage of events indicating potential
availability issues (e.g. failovers to alternative devices,
or excessive workload swapping)

■ Number and percentage of each type of event per

platform or application

■ Number and ratio of events compared with the

number of incidents.

4.1.9 Challenges, Critical Success Factors
and risks

4.1.9.1 Challenges
There are a number of challenges that might be
encountered:

■ An initial challenge may be to obtain funding for the

necessary tools and effort needed to install and exploit
the benefits of the tools.

■ One of the greatest challenges is setting the correct

level of filtering. Setting the level of filtering
incorrectly can result in either being flooded with
relatively insignificant events, or not being able to
detect relatively important events until it is too late.

■ Rolling out of the necessary monitoring agents across
the entire IT infrastructure may be a difficult and time-
consuming activity requiring an ongoing commitment
over quite a long period of time – there is a danger
that other activities may arise that could divert
resources and delay the rollout.

■ Acquiring the necessary skills can be time consuming

and costly.

4.1.9.2 Critical Success Factors
In order to obtain the necessary funding a compelling
Business Case should be prepared showing how the
benefits of effective Event Management can far outweigh
the costs – giving a positive return on investment.

Service Operation processes  |

45

One of the most important CSFs is achieving the correct
level of filtering. This is complicated by the fact that the
significance of events changes. For example, a user
logging into a system today is normal, but if that user
leaves the organization and tries to log in it is a security
breach.

There are three keys to the correct level of filtering, 
as follows:

■ Integrate Event Management into all Service

Management processes where feasible. This will ensure
that only the events significant to these processes 
are reported.

■ Design new services with Event Management in mind

(this is discussed in detail in paragraph 4.1.10).
■ Trial and error. No matter how thoroughly Event
Management is prepared, there will be classes of
events that are not properly filtered. Event
Management must therefore include a formal process
to evaluate the effectiveness of filtering.

Proper planning is needed for the rollout of the
monitoring agent software across the entire IT
Infrastructure. This should be regarded as a project with
realistic timescales and adequate resources being allocated
and protected throughout the duration of the project.

4.1.9.3 Risks
The key risks are really those already mentioned above:
failure to obtain adequate funding; ensuring the correct
level of filtering; and failure to maintain momentum in
rolling out the necessary monitoring agents across the IT
Infrastructure. If any of these risks is not addressed it could
adversely impact on the success of Event Management.

Designing for Event Management

4.1.10
Effective Event Management is not designed once a
service has been deployed into Operations. Since Event
Management is the basis for monitoring the performance
and availability of a service, the exact targets and
mechanisms for monitoring should be specified and
agreed during the Availability and Capacity Management
processes (see Service Design publication).

However, this does not mean that Event Management is
designed by a group of remote system developers and
then released to Operations Management together with
the system that has to be managed. Nor does it mean
that, once designed and agreed, Event Management
becomes static – day-to-day operations will define
additional events, priorities, alerts and other improvements

that will feed through the Continual Improvement process
back into Service Strategy, Service Design etc.

Service Operation functions will be expected to participate
in the design of the service and how it is measured (see
section 3.4).

For Event Management, the specific design areas include
the following.

4.1.10.1 Instrumentation
Instrumentation is the definition of what can be monitored
about CIs and the way in which their behaviour can be
affected. In other words, instrumentation is about defining
and designing exactly how to monitor and control the IT
Infrastructure and IT services.

Instrumentation is partly about a set of decisions that
need to be made and partly about designing mechanisms
to execute these decisions.

Decisions that need to be made include:

■ What needs to be monitored?
■ What type of monitoring is required (e.g. active or

passive; performance or output)?

■ When do we need to generate an event?
■ What type of information needs to be communicated

in the event?

■ Who are the messages intended for?

Mechanisms that need to be designed include:

■ How will events be generated?
■ Does the CI already have event generation

mechanisms as a standard feature and, if so, which of
these will be used? Are they sufficient or does the CI
need to be customized to include additional
mechanisms or information?

■ What data will be used to populate the Event Record?
■ Are events generated automatically or does the CI

have to be polled?

■ Where will events be logged and stored?
■ How will supplementary data be gathered?

Note: A strong interface exists here with the application’s
design. All applications should be coded in such a way
that meaningful and detailed error messages/codes are
generated at the exact point of failure – so that these can
be included in the event and allow swift diagnosis and
resolution of the underlying cause. The need for the
inclusion and testing of such error messaging is covered in
more detail in the Service Transition publication.

46

| Service Operation processes

4.1.10.2 Error messaging
Error messaging is important for all components
(hardware, software, networks, etc.). It is particularly
important that all software applications are designed to
support Event Management. This might include the
provision of meaningful error messages and/or codes that
clearly indicate the specific point of failure and the most
likely cause. In such cases the testing of new applications
should include testing of accurate event generation.

Newer technologies such as Java Management Extensions
(JMX) or HawkNL™ provide the tools for building
distributed, web-based, modular and dynamic solutions for
managing and monitoring devices, applications and
service-driven networks. These can be used to reduce or
eliminate the need for programmers to include error
messaging within the code – allowing a valuable level of
normalization and code-independence.

4.1.10.3 Event Detection and Alert Mechanisms
Good Event Management design will also include the
design and population of the tools used to filter, correlate
and escalate Events.

The Correlation Engine specifically will need to be
populated with the rules and criteria that will determine
the significance and subsequent action for each type 
of event.

Thorough design of the event detection and alert
mechanisms requires the following:

■ Business knowledge in relationship to any business

processes being managed via Event Management

■ Detailed knowledge of the Service Level Requirements

of the service being supported by each CI

■ Knowledge of who is going to be supporting the CI
■ Knowledge of what constitutes normal and abnormal

operation of the CI

■ Knowledge of the significance of multiple similar

events (on the same CI or various similar CIs

■ An understanding of what they need to know to

support the CI effectively

■ Information that can help in the diagnosis of problems

with the CI

■ Familiarity with incident prioritization and

categorization codes so that if it is necessary to create
an Incident Record, these codes can be provided

■ Knowledge of other CIs that may be dependent on

the affected CI, or those CIs on which it depends

■ Availability of Known Error information from vendors

or from previous experience.

4.1.10.4 Identification of thresholds
Thresholds themselves are not set and managed through
Event Management. However, unless these are properly
designed and communicated during the instrumentation
process, it will be difficult to determine which level of
performance is appropriate for each CI.

Also, most thresholds are not constant. They typically
consist of a number of related variables. For example, the
maximum number of concurrent users before response
time slows will vary depending on what other jobs are
active on the server. This knowledge is often only gained
by experience, which means that Correlation Engines have
to be continually tuned and updated through the process
of Continual Service Improvement.

4.2 INCIDENT MANAGEMENT

In ITIL terminology, an ‘incident’ is defined as:

An unplanned interruption to an IT service or
reduction in the quality of an IT service. Failure of a
configuration item that has not yet impacted service
is also an incident, for example failure of one disk
from a mirror set.

Incident Management is the process for dealing with
all incidents; this can include failures, questions or
queries reported by the users (usually via a telephone
call to the Service Desk), by technical staff, or
automatically detected and reported by event
monitoring tools.

4.2.1 Purpose/goal/objective
The primary goal of the Incident Management process is
to restore normal service operation as quickly as possible
and minimize the adverse impact on business operations,
thus ensuring that the best possible levels of service
quality and availability are maintained. ‘Normal service
operation’ is defined here as service operation within 
SLA limits.

4.2.2 Scope
Incident Management includes any event which disrupts,
or which could disrupt, a service. This includes events
which are communicated directly by users, either through
the Service Desk or through an interface from Event
Management to Incident Management tools.

Incidents can also be reported and/or logged by technical
staff (if, for example, they notice something untoward with
a hardware or network component they may report or log
an incident and refer it to the Service Desk). This does not

Service Operation processes  |

47

mean, however, that all events are incidents. Many classes
of events are not related to disruptions at all, but are
indicators of normal operation or are simply informational
(see section 4.1).

Although both incidents and service requests are reported
to the Service Desk, this does not mean that they are the
same. Service requests do not represent a disruption to
agreed service, but are a way of meeting the customer’s
needs and may be addressing an agreed target in an SLA.
Service requests are dealt with by the Request Fulfilment
process (see section 4.3).

4.2.3 Value to business
The value of Incident Management includes:

■ The ability to detect and resolve incidents, which

results in lower downtime to the business, which in
turn means higher availability of the service. This
means that the business is able to exploit the
functionality of the service as designed.

■ The ability to align IT activity to real-time business

priorities. This is because Incident Management
includes the capability to identify business priorities
and dynamically allocate resources as necessary.
■ The ability to identify potential improvements to

services. This happens as a result of understanding
what constitutes an incident and also from being in
contact with the activities of business operational staff.
■ The Service Desk can, during its handling of incidents,

identify additional service or training requirements
found in IT or the business.

Incident Management is highly visible to the business, and
it is therefore easier to demonstrate its value than most
areas in Service Operation. For this reason, Incident
Management is often one of the first processes to be
implemented in Service Management projects. The added
benefit of doing this is that Incident Management can be
used to highlight other areas that need attention –
thereby providing a justification for expenditure on
implementing other processes.

4.2.4 Policies/principles/basic concepts
There are some basic things that need to be taken into
account and decided when considering Incident
Management. These are covered in this section.

4.2.4.1 Timescales
Timescales must be agreed for all incident-handling stages
(these will differ depending upon the priority level of the
incident) – based upon the overall incident response and

resolution targets within SLAs – and captured as targets
within OLAs and Underpinning Contracts (UCs). All support
groups should be made fully aware of these timescales.
Service Management tools should be used to automate
timescales and escalate the incident as required based on
pre-defined rules.

4.2.4.2 Incident Models
Many incidents are not new – they involve dealing with
something that has happened before and may well
happen again. For this reason, many organizations will
find it helpful to pre-define ‘standard’ Incident Models –
and apply them to appropriate incidents when they occur.

An Incident Model is a way of pre-defining the steps that
should be taken to handle a process (in this case a process
for dealing with a particular type of incident) in an agreed
way. Support tools can then be used to manage the
required process. This will ensure that ‘standard’ incidents
are handled in a pre-defined path and within pre-defined
timescales.

Incidents which would require specialized handling can be
treated in this way (for example, security-related incidents
can be routed to Information Security Management and
capacity- or performance-related incidents that would be
routed to Capacity Management.

The Incident Model should include:

■ The steps that should be taken to handle the incident
■ The chronological order these steps should be taken

in, with any dependences or co-processing defined

■ Responsibilities; who should do what
■ Timescales and thresholds for completion of the

actions

■ Escalation procedures; who should be contacted and

when

■ Any necessary evidence-preservation activities

(particularly relevant for security- and capacity-related
incidents).

The models should be input to the incident-handling
support tools in use and the tools should then automate
the handling, management and escalation of the process.

4.2.4.3 Major incidents
A separate procedure, with shorter timescales and greater
urgency, must be used for ‘major’ incidents. A definition of
what constitutes a major incident must be agreed and
ideally mapped on to the overall incident prioritization
system – such that they will be dealt with through the
major incident process.

Note: People sometimes use loose terminology and/or
confuse a major incident with a problem. In reality, an
incident remains an incident forever – it may grow in
impact or priority to become a major incident, but an
incident never ‘becomes’ a problem. A problem is the
underlying cause of one or more incidents and remains a
separate entity always!

Some lower-priority incidents may also have to be
handled through this procedure – due to potential
business impact – and some major incidents may not
need to be handled in this way if the cause and
resolutions are obvious and the normal incident process
can easily cope within agreed target resolution times –
provided the impact remains low!

Where necessary, the major incident procedure should
include the dynamic establishment of a separate major
incident team under the direct leadership of the Incident
Manager, formulated to concentrate on this incident alone
to ensure that adequate resources and focus are provided
to finding a swift resolution. If the Service Desk Manager is
also fulfilling the role of Incident Manager (say in a small
organization), then a separate person may need to be
designated to lead the major incident investigation team –
so as to avoid conflict of time or priorities – but should
ultimately report back to the Incident Manager.

If the cause of the incident needs to be investigated at the
same time, then the Problem Manager would be involved
as well but the Incident Manager must ensure that service
restoration and underlying cause are kept separate.
Throughout, the Service Desk would ensure that all
activities are recorded and users are kept fully informed of
progress.

4.2.5 Process activities, methods and
techniques
The process to be followed during the management of an
incident is shown in Figure 4.2. The process includes the
following steps.

4.2.5.1 Incident identification
Work cannot begin on dealing with an incident until it is
known that an incident has occurred. It is usually
unacceptable, from a business perspective, to wait until a
user is impacted and contacts the Service Desk. As far as
possible, all key components should be monitored so that
failures or potential failures are detected early so that the
incident management process can be started quickly.
Ideally, incidents should be resolved before they have an
impact on users!

Please see section 4.1 for further details.

4.2.5.2 Incident logging
All incidents must be fully logged and date/time stamped,
regardless of whether they are raised through a Service
Desk telephone call or whether automatically detected via
an event alert.

Note: If Service Desk and/or support staff visit the
customers to deal with one incident, they may be asked to
deal with further incidents ‘while they are there’. It is
important that if this is done, a separate Incident Record is
logged for each additional incident handled – to ensure
that a historical record is kept and credit is given for the
work undertaken.

All relevant information relating to the nature of the
incident must be logged so that a full historical record is
maintained – and so that if the incident has to be referred
to other support group(s), they will have all relevant
information to hand to assist them.

The information needed for each incident is likely to
include:

■ Unique reference number
■ Incident categorization (often broken down into
between two and four levels of sub-categories)

■ Incident urgency
■ Incident impact
■ Incident prioritization
■ Date/time recorded
■ Name/ID of the person and/or group recording the

incident

■ Method of notification (telephone, automatic, e-mail,

in person, etc.)

■ Name/department/phone/location of user
■ Call-back method (telephone, mail, etc.)
■ Description of symptoms
■ Incident status (active, waiting, closed, etc.)
■ Related CI
■ Support group/person to which the incident is

allocated

■ Related problem/Known Error
■ Activities undertaken to resolve the incident
■ Resolution date and time
■ Closure category
■ Closure date and time.

Note: If the Service Desk does not work 24/7 and
responsibility for first-line incident logging and handling
passes to another group, such as IT Operations or Network

50

| Service Operation processes

Support, out of Service Desk hours, then these staff need
to be equally rigorous about logging of incident details.
Full training and awareness needs to be provided to such
staff on this issue.

4.2.5.3 Incident categorization
Part of the initial logging must be to allocate suitable
incident categorization coding so that the exact type of
the call is recorded. This will be important later when
looking at incident types/frequencies to establish trends
for use in Problem Management, Supplier Management
and other ITSM activities.

Please note that the check for Service Requests in this
process does not imply that Service Requests are incidents.
This is simply recognition of the fact that Service Requests
are sometimes incorrectly logged as incidents (e.g. a user
incorrectly enters the request as an incident from the web
interface). This check will detect any such requests and
ensure that they are passed to the Request Fulfilment
process.

Multi-level categorization is available in most tools –
usually to three or four levels of granularity. For example,
an incident may be categorized as shown in Figure 4.3.

Hardware

Server

Or

Software

Card failure

Purchase order system

All organizations are unique and it is therefore difficult to
give generic guidance on the categories an organization
should use, particularly at the lower levels. However, there
is a technique that can be used to assist an organization

to achieve a correct and complete set of categories – if
they are starting from scratch! The steps involve:

1 Hold a brainstorming session among the relevant
support groups, involving the SD Supervisor and
Incident and Problem Managers.

2 Use this session to decide the ‘best guess’ top-level
categories – and include an ‘other’ category. Set up
the relevant logging tools to use these categories for a
trial period.

3 Use the categories for a short trial period (long

enough for several hundred incidents to fall into each
category, but not too long that an analysis will take
too long to perform).

4 Perform an analysis of the incidents logged during the

trial period. The number of incidents logged in each
higher-level category will confirm whether the
categories are worth having – and a more detailed
analysis of the ‘other’ category should allow
identification of any additional higher-level categories
that will be needed.

5 A breakdown analysis of the incidents within each
higher-level category should be used to decide the
lower-level categories that will be required.

6 Review and repeat these activities after a further

period – of, say, one to three months – and again
regularly to ensure that they remain relevant. Be aware
that any significant changes to categorization may
cause some difficulties for incident trending or
management reporting – so they should be stabilized
unless changes are genuinely required.

If an existing categorization scheme is in use, but it is not
thought to be working satisfactorily, the basic idea of the
technique suggested above can be used to review and
amend the existing scheme.

NOTE: Sometimes the details available at the time an
incident is logged may be incomplete, misleading or
incorrect. It is therefore important that the categorization
of the incident is checked, and updated if necessary, at
call closure time (in a separate closure categorization field,
so as not to corrupt the original categorization) – please
see paragraph 4.2.5.9.

4.2.5.4 Incident prioritization
Another important aspect of logging every incident is to
agree and allocate an appropriate prioritization code – as
this will determine how the incident is handled both by
support tools and support staff.

Prioritization can normally be determined by taking into
account both the urgency of the incident (how quickly the

Service Operation processes  |

51

business needs a resolution) and the level of impact it is
causing. An indication of impact is often (but not always)
the number of users being affected. In some cases, and
very importantly, the loss of service to a single user can
have a major business impact – it all depends upon who is
trying to do what – so numbers alone is not enough to
evaluate overall priority! Other factors that can also
contribute to impact levels are:

Some organizations may also recognize VIPs (high-ranking
executives, officers, diplomats, politicians, etc.) whose
incidents would be handled on a higher priority than
normal – but in such cases this is best catered for and
documented within the guidance provided to the Service
Desk staff on how to apply the priority levels, so they are
all aware of the agreed rules for VIPs, and who falls into
this category.

■ Risk to life or limb
■ The number of services affected – may be multiple

services

■ The level of financial losses
■ Effect on business reputation
■ Regulatory or legislative breaches.

An effective way of calculating these elements and
deriving an overall priority level for each incident is given
in Table 4.1:

In all cases, clear guidance – with practical examples –
should be provided for all support staff to enable them to
determine the correct urgency and impact levels, so the
correct priority is allocated. Such guidance should be
produced during service level negotiations.

However, it must be noted that there will be occasions
when, because of particular business expediency or
whatever, normal priority levels have to be overridden.
When a user is adamant that an incident’s priority level
should exceed normal guidelines, the Service Desk should
comply with such a request – and if it subsequently turns
out to be incorrect this can be resolved as an off-line
management level issue, rather than a dispute occurring
when the user is on the telephone.

It should be noted that an incident’s priority may be
dynamic – if circumstances change, or if an incident is not
resolved within SLA target times, then the priority must be
altered to reflect the new situation.

Note: some tools may have constraints that make it
difficult automatically to calculate performance against SLA
targets if a priority is changed during the lifetime of an
incident. However, if circumstances do change, the change
in priority should be made – and if necessary manual
adjustments made to reporting tools. Ideally, tools with
such constraints should not be selected.

4.2.5.5 Initial diagnosis
If the incident has been routed via the Service Desk, the
Service Desk Analyst must carry out initial diagnosis,
typically while the user is still on the telephone – if the
call is raised in this way – to try to discover the full
symptoms of the incident and to determine exactly what
has gone wrong and how to correct it. It is at this stage
that diagnostic scripts and known error information can be
most valuable in allowing earlier and accurate diagnosis.

If possible, the Service Desk Analyst will resolve the
incident while the user is still on the telephone – and
close the incident if the resolution is successful.

If the Service Desk Analyst cannot resolve the incident
while the user is still on the telephone, but there is a
prospect that the Service Desk may be able to do so
within the agreed time limit without assistance from other
support groups, the Analyst should inform the user of their
intentions, give the user the incident reference number
and attempt to find a resolution.

4.2.5.6 Incident escalation
■ Functional escalation. As soon as it becomes clear

that the Service Desk is unable to resolve the incident
itself (or when target times for first-point resolution
have been exceeded – whichever comes first!) the
incident must be immediately escalated for further
support.
If the organization has a second-level support group
and the Service Desk believes that the incident can be
resolved by that group, it should refer the incident to

52

| Service Operation processes

them. If it is obvious that the incident will need
deeper technical knowledge, or when the second-level
group has not been able to resolve the incident within
agreed target times (whichever comes first), the
incident must be immediately escalated to the
appropriate third-level support group. Note that third-
level support groups may be internal – but they may
also be third parties such as software suppliers or
hardware manufacturers or maintainers. The rules for
escalation and handling of incidents must be agreed
in OLAs and UCs with internal and external support
groups respectively.
Note: Incident Ownership remains with the Service
Desk! Regardless of where an incident is referred to
during its life, ownership of the incident remains with
the Service Desk at all times. The Service Desk remains
responsible for tracking progress, keeping users
informed and ultimately for Incident Closure.

■ Hierarchic escalation. If incidents are of a serious

nature (for example Priority 1 incidents) the
appropriate IT managers must be notified, for
informational purposes at least. Hierarchic escalation is
also used if the ‘Investigation and Diagnosis’ and
‘Resolution and Recovery’ steps are taking too long or
proving too difficult. Hierarchic escalation should
continue up the management chain so that senior
managers are aware and can be prepared and take
any necessary action, such as allocating additional
resources or involving suppliers/maintainers. Hierarchic
escalation is also used when there is contention about
to whom the incident is allocated.
Hierarchic escalation can, of course, be initiated by the
affected users or customer management, as they see
fit – that is why it is important that IT managers are
made aware so that they can anticipate and prepare
for any such escalation.

The exact levels and timescales for both functional and
hierarchic escalation need to be agreed, taking into
account SLA targets, and embedded within support tools
which can then be used to police and control the process
flow within agreed timescales.

The Service Desk should keep the user informed of any
relevant escalation that takes place and ensure the
Incident Record is updated accordingly to keep a full
history of actions.

Note regarding Incident allocation
There may be many incidents in a queue with the same
priority level – so it will be the job of the Service Desk

and/or Incident Management staff initially, in conjunction
with managers of the various support groups to which
incidents are escalated, to decide the order in which
incidents should be picked up and actively worked on.
These managers must ensure that incidents are dealt with
in true business priority order and that staff are not
allowed to ‘cherry-pick’ the incidents they choose!

4.2.5.7 Investigation and Diagnosis
In the case of incidents where the user is just seeking
information, the Service Desk should be able to provide
this fairly quickly and resolve the service request – but if a
fault is being reported, this is an incident and likely to
require some degree of investigation and diagnosis.

Each of the support groups involved with the incident
handling will investigate and diagnose what has gone
wrong – and all such activities (including details of any
actions taken to try to resolve or re-create the incident)
should be fully documented in the incident record so that
a complete historical record of all activities is maintained
at all times.

Note: Valuable time can often be lost if investigation and
diagnostic action (or indeed resolution or recovery actions)
are performed serially. Where possible, such activities
should be performed in parallel to reduce overall
timescales – and support tools should be designed and/or
selected to allow this. However, care should be taken to
coordinate activities, particularly resolution or recovery
activities, otherwise the actions of different groups may
conflict or further complicate a resolution!

This investigation is likely to include such actions as:

■ Establishing exactly what has gone wrong or being

sought by the user

■ Understanding the chronological order of events
■ Confirming the full impact of the incident, including

the number and range of users affected

■ Identifying any events that could have triggered the

incident (e.g. a recent change, some user action?)

■ Knowledge searches looking for previous occurrences

by searching previous Incident/Problem Records
and/or Known Error Databases or
manufacturers’/suppliers’ Error Logs or Knowledge
Databases.

4.2.5.8 Resolution and Recovery
When a potential resolution has been identified, this
should be applied and tested. The specific actions to be
undertaken and the people who will be involved in taking

Service Operation processes  |

53

the recovery actions may vary, depending upon the nature
of the fault – but could involve:

■ Asking the user to undertake directed activities on

their own desk top or remote equipment

■ The Service Desk implementing the resolution either
centrally (say, rebooting a server) or remotely using
software to take control of the user’s desktop to
diagnose and implement a resolution

■ Specialist support groups being asked to implement

specific recovery actions (e.g. Network Support
reconfiguring a router)

■ A third-party supplier or maintainer being asked to

resolve the fault.

Even when a resolution has been found, sufficient testing
must be performed to ensure that recovery action is
complete and that the service has been fully restored to
the user(s).

NOTE: in some cases it may be necessary for two or more
groups to take separate, though perhaps coordinated,
recovery actions for an overall resolution to be
implemented. In such cases Incident Management must
coordinate the activities and liaise with all parties involved.

Regardless of the actions taken, or who does them, the
Incident Record must be updated accordingly with all
relevant information and details so that a full history 
is maintained.

The resolving group should pass the incident back to the
Service Desk for closure action.

4.2.5.9 Incident Closure
The Service Desk should check that the incident is fully
resolved and that the users are satisfied and willing to
agree the incident can be closed. The Service Desk should
also check the following:

■ Closure categorization. Check and confirm that the

initial incident categorization was correct or, where
the categorization subsequently turned out to be
incorrect, update the record so that a correct closure
categorization is recorded for the incident – seeking
advise or guidance from the resolving group(s) as
necessary.

■ User satisfaction survey. Carry out a user satisfaction
call-back or e-mail survey for the agreed percentage of
incidents.

■ Incident documentation. Chase any outstanding
details and ensure that the Incident Record is fully
documented so that a full historic record at a
sufficient level of detail is complete.

■ Ongoing or recurring problem? Determine (in

conjunction with resolver groups) whether it is likely
that the incident could recur and decide whether any
preventive action is necessary to avoid this. In
conjunction with Problem Management, raise a
Problem Record in all such cases so that preventive
action is initiated.

■ Formal closure. Formally close the Incident Record.

Note: Some organizations may chose to utilize an
automatic closure period on specific, or even all, incidents
(e.g. incident will be automatically closed after two
working days if no further contact is made by the user).
Where this approach is to be considered, it must first be
fully discussed and agreed with the users – and widely
publicized so that all users and IT staff are aware of this. It
may be inappropriate to use this method for certain types
of incidents – such as major incidents or those involving
VIPs, etc.

Rules for re-opening incidents
Despite all adequate care, there will be occasions when
incidents recur even though they have been formally
closed. Because of such cases, it is wise to have pre-
defined rules about if and when an incident can be re-
opened. It might make sense, for example, to agree that if
the incident recurs within one working day then it can be
re-opened – but that beyond this point a new incident
must be raised, but linked to the previous incident(s).

The exact time threshold/rules may vary between
individual organizations – but clear rules should be agreed
and documented and guidance given to all Service Desk
staff so that uniformity is applied.

4.2.6 Triggers, input and output/inter-
process interfaces
Incidents can be triggered in many ways. The most
common route is when a user rings the Service Desk or
completes a web-based incident-logging screen, but
increasingly incidents are raised automatically via Event
Management tools. Technical staff may notice potential
failures and raise an incident, or ask the Service Desk to do
so, so that the fault can be addressed. Some incidents may
also arise at the initiation of suppliers – who may send
some form of notification of a potential or actual difficulty
that needs attention.

The interfaces with Incident Management include:

■ Problem Management: Incident Management forms

part of the overall process of dealing with problems in
the organization. Incidents are often caused by
underlying problems, which must be solved to prevent

54

| Service Operation processes

the incident from recurring. Incident Management
provides a point where these are reported.

■ Configuration Management provides the data used
to identify and progress incidents. One of the uses of
the CMS is to identify faulty equipment and to assess
the impact of an incident. It is also used to identify
the users affected by potential problems. The CMS
also contains information about which categories of
incident should be assigned to which support group.
In turn, Incident Management can maintain the status
of faulty CIs. It can also assist Configuration
Management to audit the infrastructure when working
to resolve an incident.

■ Change Management: Where a change is required to
implement a workaround or resolution, this will need
to be logged as an RFC and progressed through
Change Management. In turn, Incident Management is
able to detect and resolve incidents that arise from
failed changes.

■ Capacity Management: Incident Management

provides a trigger for performance monitoring where
there appears to be a performance problem. Capacity
Management may develop workarounds for incidents.

■ Availability Management; will use Incident

Management data to determine the availability of IT
services and look at where the incident lifecycle can
be improved.

■ SLM: The ability to resolve incidents in a specified
time is a key part of delivering an agreed level of
service. Incident Management enables SLM to define
measurable responses to service disruptions. It also
provides reports that enable SLM to review SLAs
objectively and regularly. In particular, Incident
Management is able to assist in defining where
services are at their weakest, so that SLM can define
actions as part of the Service Improvement Plan (SIP) –
please see the Continual Service Improvement
publication for more details. SLM defines the
acceptable levels of service within which Incident
Management works, including:
● Incident response times
● Impact definitions
● Target fix times
● Service definitions, which are mapped to users
● Rules for requesting services
● Expectations for providing feedback to users.

4.2.7 Information Management
Most information used in Incident Management comes
from the following sources:

■ The Incident Management tools, which contain

information about:
● Incident and problem history
● Incident categories
● Action taken to resolve incidents
● Diagnostic scripts which can help first-line analysts

to resolve the incident, or at least gather
information that will help second- or third-line
analysts resolve it faster.

■ Incident Records, which include the following data:

● Unique reference number
● Incident classification
● Date and time of recording and any subsequent

activities

● Name and identity of the person recording and

updating the Incident Record

● Name/organization/contact details of affected

user(s)

● Description of the incident symptoms
● Details of any actions taken to try to diagnose,

resolve or re-create the incident

● Incident category, impact, urgency and priority
● Relationship with other incidents, problems,

changes or Known Errors

● Closure details, including time, category, action
taken and identity of person closing the record.

Incident Management also requires access to the CMS.
This will help it to identify the CIs affected by the incident
and also to estimate the impact of the incident.

The Known Error Database provides valuable information
about possible resolutions and workarounds. This is
discussed in detail in paragraph 4.4.7.2.

4.2.8 Metrics
The metrics that should be monitored and reported upon
to judge the efficiency and effectiveness of the Incident
Management process, and its operation, will include:

■ Total numbers of Incidents (as a control measure)
■ Breakdown of incidents at each stage (e.g. logged,

work in progress, closed etc)

■ Size of current incident backlog
■ Number and percentage of major incidents
■ Mean elapsed time to achieve incident resolution or

circumvention, broken down by impact code

■ Percentage of incidents handled within agreed

response time (incident response-time targets may be
specified in SLAs, for example, by impact and urgency
codes)

Service Operation processes  |

55

■ Average cost per incident
■ Number of incidents reopened and as a percentage of

the total

■ Number and percentage of incidents incorrectly

assigned

■ Number and percentage of incidents incorrectly

categorized

■ Percentage of Incidents closed by the Service Desk
without reference to other levels of support (often
referred to as ‘first point of contact’)

■ Number and percentage the of incidents processed

per Service Desk agent

■ Number and percentage of incidents resolved

remotely, without the need for a visit

■ Number of incidents handled by each Incident Model
■ Breakdown of incidents by time of day, to help

pinpoint peaks and ensure matching of resources.

Reports should be produced under the authority of the
Incident Manager, who should draw up a schedule and
distribution list, in collaboration with the Service Desk and
support groups handling incidents. Distribution lists
should at least include IT Services Management and
specialist support groups. Consider also making the data
available to users and customers, for example via SLA
reports.

4.2.9 Challenges, Critical Success Factors
and risks

4.2.9.1 Challenges
The following challenges will exist for successful Incident
Management:

■ The ability to detect incidents as early as possible. This
will require education of the users reporting incidents,
the use of Super Users (see paragraph 6.2.4.5) and the
configuration of Event Management tools.

■ Convincing all staff (technical teams as well as users)

that all incidents must be logged, and encouraging
the use of self-help web-based capabilities (which can
speed up assistance and reduce resource
requirements).

■ Availability of information about problems and Known

Errors. This will enable Incident Management staff to
learn from previous incidents and also to track the
status of resolutions.

■ Integration into the CMS to determine relationships
between CIs and to refer to the history of CIs when
performing first-line support.

■ Integration into the SLM process. This will assist

Incident Management correctly to assess the impact
and priority of incidents and assists in defining and
executing escalation procedures. SLM will also benefit
from the information learned during Incident
Management, for example in determining whether
service level performance targets are realistic and
achievable.

4.2.9.2 Critical Success Factors
The following factors will be critical for successful Incident
Management:

■ A good Service Desk is key to successful Incident

Management

■ Clearly defined targets to work to – as defined in SLAs
■ Adequate customer-oriented and technically training
support staff with the correct skill levels, at all stages
of the process

■ Integrated support tools to drive and control the

process

■ OLAs and UCs that are capable of influencing and
shaping the correct behaviour of all support staff.

4.2.9.3 Risks
The risks to successful Incident Management are actually
similar to some of the challenges and the reverse of some
of the Critical Success Factors mentioned above. They
include:

■ Being inundated with incidents that cannot be

handled within acceptable timescales due to a lack of
available or properly trained resources

■ Incidents being bogged down and not progressed as
intended because of inadequate support tools to raise
alerts and prompt progress

■ Lack of adequate and/or timely information sources

because of inadequate tools or lack of integration

■ Mismatches in objectives or actions because of poorly

aligned or non-existent OLAs and/or UCs.

4.3 REQUEST FULFILMENT

The term ‘Service Request’ is used as a generic description
for many varying types of demands that are placed upon
the IT Department by the users. Many of these are actually
small changes – low risk, frequently occurring, low cost,
etc. (e.g. a request to change a password, a request to
install an additional software application onto a particular
workstation, a request to relocate some items of desktop
equipment) or maybe just a question requesting
information – but their scale and frequent, low-risk nature

56

| Service Operation processes

means that they are better handled by a separate process,
rather than being allowed to congest and obstruct the
normal Incident and Change Management processes.

4.3.1 Purpose/goal/objective
Request Fulfilment is the processes of dealing with Service
Requests from the users. The objectives of the Request
Fulfilment process include:

■ To provide a channel for users to request and receive

standard services for which a pre-defined approval and
qualification process exists

■ To provide information to users and customers about

the availability of services and the procedure for
obtaining them

■ To source and deliver the components of requested
standard services (e.g. licences and software media)

■ To assist with general information, complaints or

comments.

4.3.2 Scope
The process needed to fulfil a request will vary depending
upon exactly what is being requested – but can usually be
broken down into a set of activities that have to be
performed. Some organizations will be comfortable to let
the Service Requests be handled through their Incident
Management processes (and tools) – with Service Requests
being handled as a particular type of ‘incident’ (using a
high-level categorization system to identify those
‘incidents’ that are in fact Service Requests).

Note, however, that there is a significant difference here –
an incident is usually an unplanned event whereas a
Service Request is usually something that can and should
be planned!

Therefore, in an organization where large numbers of
Service Requests have to be handled, and where the
actions to be taken to fulfil those requests are very varied
or specialized, it may be appropriate to handle Service
Requests as a completely separate work stream – and to
record and manage them as a separate record type.

This may be particularly appropriate if the organization
has chosen to widen the scope of the Service Desk to
expand upon just IT-related issues and use the desk as a
focal point for other types or request for service – for
example, a request to service a photocopier or even going
so far as to include, for example, building management
issues, such as a need to replace a light fitment or repair a
leak in the plumbing.

Note: It will ultimately be up to each organization to
decide and document which request it will handle

through the Request Fulfilment process and which others
will have to go through more formal Change
Management. There will always be grey areas which
prevent generic guidance from being usefully prescribed.

4.3.3 Value to business
The value of Request Fulfilment is to provide quick and
effective access to standard services which business staff
can use to improve their productivity or the quality of
business services and products.

Request Fulfilment effectively reduces the bureaucracy
involved in requesting and receiving access to existing or
new services, thus also reducing the cost of providing
these services. Centralizing fulfilment also increases the
level of control over these services. This in turn can help
reduce costs through centralized negotiation with
suppliers, and can also help to reduce the cost of support.

4.3.4 Policies/principles/basic concepts
Many Service Requests will be frequently recurring, so a
predefined process flow (a model) can be devised to
include the stages needed to fulfil the request, the
individuals or support groups involved, target timescales
and escalation paths. Service Requests will usually be
satisfied by implementing a Standard Change (see the
Service Transition publication for further details on
Standard Changes). The ownership of Service Requests
resides with the Service Desk, which monitors, escalates,
dispatches and often fulfils the user request.

4.3.4.1 Request Models
Some Service Requests will occur frequently and will
require handling in a consistent manner in order to meet
agreed service levels. To assist this, many organizations will
wish to create pre-defined Request Models (which typically
include some form of pre-approval by Change
Management). This is similar in concept to the idea of
Incident Models already described in paragraph 4.2.4.2,
but applied to Service Requests.

4.3.5 Process activities, methods and
techniques

4.3.5.1 Menu selection
Request Fulfilment offers great opportunities for self-help
practices where users can generate a Service Request
using technology that links into Service Management
tools. Ideally, users should be offered a ‘menu’-type
selection via a web interface, so that they can select and
input details of Service Requests from a pre-defined list –

Service Operation processes  |

57

appropriate expectations can be set by giving target
delivery and/or implementation targets/dates (in line with
SLA targets). Where organizations are offering a self-help IT
support capability to the users, it would make sense to
combine this with a Request Fulfilment system as
described.

Specialist web tools to offer this type of ‘shopping basket’
experience can be used together with interfaces directly to
the back-end integrated ITSM tools, or other more general
business process automation or Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP) tools that may be used for management of
the Request Fulfilment activities.

4.3.5.2 Financial approval
One important extra step that is likely to be needed when
dealing with a service request is that of financial approval.

Most requests will have some form of financial
implications, regardless of the type of commercial
arrangements in place. The cost of fulfilling the request
must first be established. It may be possible to agree fixed
prices for ‘standard’ requests – and prior approval for such
requests may be given as part of the organization’s overall
annual financial management. In all other cases, an
estimate of the cost must be produced and submitted to
the user for financial approval (the user may need to seek
approval up their management/financial chain). If approval
is given, in addition to fulfilling the request, the process
must also include charging (billing or cross-charging) for
the work done – if charging is in place.

4.3.5.3 Other approval
In some cases further approval may be needed – such as
compliance-related or wider business approval. Request
Fulfilment must have the ability to define and check such
approvals where needed.

4.3.5.4 Fulfilment
The actual fulfilment activity will depend upon the nature
of the Service Request. Some simpler requests may be
completed by the Service Desk, acting as first-line support,
while others will have to be forwarded to specialist groups
and/or suppliers for fulfilment.

Some organizations may have specialist fulfilment groups
(to ‘pick, pack and dispatch’) – or may have outsourced
some fulfilment activities to a third-party supplier(s). The
Service Desk should monitor and chase progress and keep
users informed throughout, regardless of the actual
fulfilment source.

4.3.5.5 Closure
When the Service Request has been fulfilled it must be
referred back to the Service Desk for closure. The Service
Desk should go through the same closure process as
described earlier in paragraph 4.2.5.9 – checking that the
user is satisfied with the outcome.

4.3.6 Triggers, input and output/inter-
process interfaces
Most requests will be triggered through either a user
calling the Service Desk or a user completing some form
of self-help web-based input screen to make their request.
The latter will often involve a selection from a portfolio of
available request types.

The primary interfaces with Request Fulfilment include:

■ Service Desk/Incident Management: Many Service
Requests may come in via the Service Desk and may
be initially handled through the Incident Management
process. Some organizations may choose that all
requests are handled via this route – but others may
choose to have a separate process, for reasons already
discussed earlier in this chapter.

■ A strong link is also needed between Request

Fulfilment, Release, Asset and Configuration
Management – as some requests will be for the
deployment of new or upgraded components that can
be automatically deployed. In such cases the ‘release’
can be pre-defined, built and tested but only
deployed upon request by those who want the
‘release’. Upon deployment, the CMS will have to be
updated to reflect the change. Where appropriate,
software licence checks/updates will also be necessary.

Where appropriate, it will be necessary to relate IT-related
Service Requests to any incidents or problems that have
initiated the need for the request (as would be the case
for any other type of change).

4.3.7 Information Management
Request Fulfilment is dependent on information from the
following sources:

■ The Service Requests will contain information about:

● What service is being requested
● Who requested and authorized the service
● Which process will be used to fulfil the request
● To whom it was assigned to and what action 

was taken

58

| Service Operation processes

● The date and time when the request was logged
as well as the date and time of all actions taken

● Closure details.

4.3.9.2 Critical Success Factors
Request Fulfilment depends on the following Critical
Success Factors:

■ Requests for Change: In some cases the Request

Fulfilment process will be initiated by an RFC. This is
typical where the Service Request relates to a CI

■ The Service Portfolio, to enable the scope of agreed

Service Request to be identified

■ Security Policies will prescribe any controls to be

executed or adhered to when providing the service,
e.g. ensuring that the requester is authorized to access
the service, or that the software is licensed.

4.3.8 Metrics
The metrics needed to judge the effectiveness and
efficiency of Request Fulfilment will include the following
(each metric will need to be broken down by request
type, within the period):

■ Agreement of what services will be standardized and
who is authorized to request them. The cost of these
services must also be agreed. This may be done as
part of the SLM process. Any variances of the services
must also be defined.

■ Publication of the services to users as part of the

Service Catalogue. It is important that this part of the
Service Catalogue must be easily accessed, perhaps on
the Intranet, and should be recognized as the first
source of information for users seeking access to a
service.

■ Definition of a standard fulfilment procedure for each

of the services being requested. This includes all
procurement policies and the ability to generate
purchase orders and work orders

■ The total number of Service Requests (as a control

■ A single point of contact which can be used to

measure)

■ Breakdown of service requests at each stage (e.g.

logged, WIP, closed, etc.)

■ The size of current backlog of outstanding Service

Requests

■ The mean elapsed time for handling each type of

Service Request

■ The number and percentage of Service Requests

completed within agreed target times

■ The average cost per type of Service Request
■ Level of client satisfaction with the handling of Service

Requests (as measured in some form of satisfaction
survey).

4.3.9 Challenges, Critical Success Factors
and risks

4.3.9.1 Challenges
The following challenges will be faced when introducing
Request Fulfilment:

■ Clearly defining and documenting the type of requests

that will be handled within the Request Fulfilment
process (and those that will either go through the
Service Desk and be handled as incidents or those
that will need to go through formal Change
Management) – so that all parties are absolutely clear
on the scope.

■ Establishing self-help front-end capabilities that allow

the users to interface successfully with the Request
Fulfilment process.

request the service. This is often provided by the
Service Desk or through an Intranet request, but could
be through an automated request directly into the
Request Fulfilment or procurement system.

■ Self-service tools needed to provide a front-end

interface to the users. It is essential that these
integrate with the back-end fulfilment tools, often
managed through Incident or Change Management.

4.3.9.3 Risks
Risks that may be encountered with Request Fulfilment
include:

■ Poorly defined scope, where people are unclear about

exactly what the process is expected to handle

■ Poorly designed or implemented user interfaces so
that users have difficulty raising the requests that 
they need

■ Badly designed or operated back-end fulfilment
processes that are incapable of dealing with the
volume or nature of the requests being made

■ Inadequate monitoring capabilities so that accurate

metrics cannot be gathered.

4.4 PROBLEM MANAGEMENT

ITIL defines a ‘problem’ as the unknown cause of one or
more incidents.

4.4.1 Purpose/goal/objective
Problem Management is the process responsible for
managing the lifecycle of all problems. The primary

Service Operation processes  |

59

objectives of Problem Management are to prevent
problems and resulting incidents from happening, to
eliminate recurring incidents and to minimize the impact
of incidents that cannot be prevented.

4.4.4 Policies/principles/basic concepts
There are some important concepts of Problem
Management that must be taken into account from the
outset. These include:

4.4.4.1 Problem Models
Many problems will be unique and will require handling in
an individual way – but it is conceivable that some
incidents may recur because of dormant or underlying
problems (for example, where the cost of a permanent
resolution will be high and a decision has been taken not
to go ahead with an expensive solution – but to ‘live with’
the problem).

As well as creating a Known Error Record in the Known
Error Database (see paragraph 4.4.5.7) to ensure quicker
diagnosis, the creation of a Problem Model for handling
such problems in the future may be helpful. This is very
similar in concept to the idea of Incident Models already
described in paragraph 4.2.4.2, but applied to problems as
well as incidents.

4.4.5 Process activities, methods and
techniques
Problem Management consists of two major processes:

■ Reactive Problem Management, which is generally

executed as part of Service Operation – and is
therefore covered in this publication

■ Proactive Problem Management which is initiated in

Service Operation, but generally driven as part of
Continual Service Improvement (see this publication
for fuller details).

The reactive Problem Management process is shown in
Figure 4.4. This is a simplified chart to show the normal
process flow, but in reality some of the states may be
iterative or variations may have to be made in order to
handle particular situations.

4.4.2 Scope
Problem Management includes the activities required to
diagnose the root cause of incidents and to determine the
resolution to those problems. It is also responsible for
ensuring that the resolution is implemented through the
appropriate control procedures, especially Change
Management and Release Management.

Problem Management will also maintain information
about problems and the appropriate workarounds and
resolutions, so that the organization is able to reduce the
number and impact of incidents over time. In this respect,
Problem Management has a strong interface with
Knowledge Management, and tools such as the Known
Error Database will be used for both.

Although Incident and Problem Management are separate
processes, they are closely related and will typically use
the same tools, and may use similar categorization, impact
and priority coding systems. This will ensure effective
communication when dealing with related incidents and
problems.

4.4.3 Value to business
Problem Management works together with Incident
Management and Change Management to ensure that IT
service availability and quality are increased. When
incidents are resolved, information about the resolution is
recorded. Over time, this information is used to speed up
the resolution time and identify permanent solutions,
reducing the number and resolution time of incidents. This
results in less downtime and less disruption to business
critical systems.

Additional value is derived from the following:

■ Higher availability of IT services
■ Higher productivity of business and IT staff
■ Reduced expenditure on workarounds or fixes that do

not work

■ Reduction in cost of effort in fire-fighting or resolving

repeat incidents.

4.4.5.1 Problem detection
It is likely that multiple ways of detecting problems will
exist in all organizations. These will include:

■ Suspicion or detection of an unknown cause of one or

more incidents by the Service Desk, resulting in a
Problem Record being raised – the desk may have
resolved the incident but has not determined a
definitive cause and suspects that it is likely to recur,
so will raise a Problem Record to allow the underlying
cause to be resolved. Alternatively, it may be
immediately obvious from the outset that an incident,
or incidents, has been caused by a major problem, so
a Problem Record will be raised without delay.

■ Analysis of an incident by a technical support group
which reveals that an underlying problem exists, or is
likely to exist.

■ Automated detection of an infrastructure or

application fault, using event/alert tools automatically
to raise an incident which may reveal the need for a
Problem Record.

■ A notification from a supplier or contractor that a

problem exists that has to be resolved.

■ Analysis of incidents as part of proactive Problem

Management – resulting in the need to raise a
Problem Record so that the underlying fault can be
investigated further.

Frequent and regular analysis of incident and problem
data must be performed to identify any trends as they
become discernible. This will require meaningful and
detailed categorization of incidents/problems and regular
reporting of patterns and areas of high occurrence. ‘Top
ten’ reporting, with drill-down capabilities to lower levels,
is useful in identifying trends.

Further details of how detected trends should be handled
are included in the Continual Service Improvement
publication.

4.4.5.2 Problem logging
Regardless of the detection method, all the relevant details
of the problem must be recorded so that a full historic
record exists. This must be date and time stamped to
allow suitable control and escalation.

A cross-reference must be made to the incident(s) which
initiated the Problem Record – and all relevant details
must be copied from the Incident Record(s) to the
Problem Record. It is difficult to be exact, as cases may
vary, but typically this will include details such as:

■ User details
■ Service details

■ Equipment details
■ Date/time initially logged
■ Priority and categorization details
■ Incident description
■ Details of all diagnostic or attempted recovery 

actions taken.

4.4.5.3 Problem Categorization
Problems must be categorized in the same way as
incidents (and it is advisable to use the same coding
system) so that the true nature of the problem can be
easily traced in the future and meaningful management
information can be obtained.

4.4.5.4 Problem Prioritization
Problems must be prioritized in the same way and for the
same reasons as incidents – but the frequency and impact
of related incidents must also be taken into account. The
coding system described earlier in Table 4.1 (which
combines impact with urgency to give an overall priority
level) can be used to prioritize problems in the same way
that it might be used for incidents, though the definitions
and guidance to support staff on what constitutes a
problem, and the related service targets at each level,
must obviously be devised separately.

Problem prioritization should also take into account the
severity of the problems. Severity in this context refers to
how serious the problem is from an infrastructure
perspective, for example:

■ Can the system be recovered, or does it need to be

replaced?

■ How much will it cost?
■ How many people, with what skills, will be needed to

fix the problem?

■ How long will it take to fix the problem?
■ How extensive is the problem (e.g. how many CIs are

affected)?

4.4.5.5 Problem Investigation and Diagnosis
An investigation should be conducted to try to diagnose
the root cause of the problem – the speed and nature of
this investigation will vary depending upon the impact,
severity and urgency of the problem – but the appropriate
level of resources and expertise should be applied to
finding a resolution commensurate with the priority 
code allocated and the service target in place for that
priority level.

There are a number of useful problem solving techniques
that can be used to help diagnose and resolve problems –

62

| Service Operation processes

and these should be used as appropriate. Such techniques
are described in more detail later in this section.

The CMS must be used to help determine the level of
impact and to assist in pinpointing and diagnosing the
exact point of failure. The Know Error Database (KEDB)
should also be accessed and problem-matching
techniques (such as key word searches) should be used to
see if the problem has occurred before and, if so, to find
the resolution.

It is often valuable to try to recreate the failure, so as to
understand what has gone wrong, and then to try various
ways of finding the most appropriate and cost-effective
resolution to the problem. To do this effectively without
causing further disruption to the users, a test system will
be necessary that mirrors the production environment.

There are many problem analysis, diagnosis and solving
techniques available and much research has been done in
this area. Some of the most useful and frequently used
techniques include:

■ Chronological Analysis: When dealing with a difficult

problem, there are often conflicting reports about
exactly what has happened and when. It is therefore
very helpful briefly to document all events in
chronological order – to provide a timeline of events.
This often makes it possible to see which events may
have been triggered by others – or to discount any
claims that are not supported by the sequence of
events.

■ Pain Value Analysis: This is where a broader view is

taken of the impact of an incident or problem, or
incident/problem type. Instead of just analysing the
number of incidents/problems of a particular type in a
particular period, a more in-depth analysis is done to
determine exactly what level of pain has been caused
to the organization/business by these
incidents/problems. A formula can be devised to
calculate this pain level. Typically this might include
taking into account:
● The number of people affected
● The duration of the downtime caused
● The cost to the business (if this can be readily

calculated or estimated).

By taking all of these factors into account, a much
more detailed picture of those incidents/problems or
incident/problem types that are causing most pain can
be determined – to allow a better focus on those
things that really matter and deserve highest priority
in resolving.

■ Kepner and Tregoe: Charles Kepner and Benjamin
Tregoe developed a useful way of problem analysis
which can be used formally to investigate deeper-
rooted problems. They defined the following stages:
● defining the problem
● describing the problem in terms of identity,

location, time and size

● establishing possible causes
● testing the most probable cause
● verifying the true cause.
The method is described in fuller detail in Appendix C.

■ Brainstorming: It can often be valuable to gather

together the relevant people, either physically or by
electronic means, and to ‘brainstorm’ the problem –
with people throwing in ideas on what the potential
cause may be and potential actions to resolve the
problem. Brainstorming sessions can be very
constructive and innovative but it is equally important
that someone, perhaps the Problem Manager,
documents the outcome and any agreed actions and
keeps a degree of control in the session(s).

■ Ishikawa Diagrams: Kaoru Ishikawa (1915–89), a

leader in Japanese quality control, developed a
method of documenting causes and effects which can
be useful in helping identify where something may be
going wrong, or be improved. Such a diagram is
typically the outcome of a brainstorming session
where problem solvers can offer suggestions. The
main goal is represented by the trunk of the diagram,
and primary factors are represented as branches.
Secondary factors are then added as stems, and so on.
Creating the diagram stimulates discussion and often
leads to increased understanding of a complex
problem. An example diagram is given in Appendix D.

■ Pareto Analysis: This is a technique for separating
important potential causes from more trivial issues.
The following steps should be taken:
1

Form a table listing the causes and their
frequency as a percentage.
Arrange the rows in the decreasing order of
importance of the causes, i.e. the most important
cause first.
Add a cumulative percentage column to the
table. By this step, the chart should look
something like Table 4.2, which illustrates 10
causes of network failure in an organization.
Create a bar chart with the causes, in order of
their percentage of total.

Superimpose a line chart of the cumulative
percentages. The completed graph is illustrated 
in Figure 4.5.
Draw line at 80% on the y-axis parallel to 
the x-axis. Then drop the line at the point 
of intersection with the curve on the x-axis. 
This point on the x-axis separates the important
causes and trivial causes. This line is represented
as a dotted line in Figure 4.5.

From this chart it is clear to see that there are three
primary causes for network failure in the organization.
These should therefore be targeted first.

| Service Operation processes

4.4.5.6 Workarounds
In some cases it may be possible to find a workaround to
the incidents caused by the problem – a temporary way of
overcoming the difficulties. For example, a manual
amendment may be made to an input file to allow a
program to complete its run successfully and allow a
billing process to complete satisfactorily, but it is
important that work on a permanent resolution continues
where this is justified – in this example the reason for the
file becoming corrupted in the first place must be found
and corrected to prevent this happening again.

In cases where a workaround is found, it is therefore
important that the problem record remains open, and
details of the workaround are always documented within
the Problem Record.

4.4.5.7 Raising a Known Error Record
As soon as the diagnosis is complete, and particularly
where a workaround has been found (even though it may
not yet be a permanent resolution), a Known Error Record
must be raised and placed in the Known Error Database –
so that if further incidents or problems arise, they can be
identified and the service restored more quickly.

However, in some cases it may be advantageous to raise a
Known Error Record even earlier in the overall process –
just for information purposes, for example – even though
the diagnosis may not be complete or a workaround
found, so it is inadvisable to set a concrete procedural
point exactly when a Known Error Record must be raised.
It should be done as soon as it becomes useful to do so!

The Known Error Database and the way it should be used
are described in more detail in paragraph 4.4.7.2.

4.4.5.8 Problem resolution
Ideally, as soon as a solution has been found, it should be
applied to resolve the problem – but in reality safeguards
may be needed to ensure that this does not cause further
difficulties. If any change in functionality is required this
will require an RFC to be raised and approved before the
resolution can be applied. If the problem is very serious
and an urgent fix is needed for business reasons, then an
Emergency RFC should be handled by the Change
Advisory Board Emergency Committee (CAB/EC) to
facilitate this urgent action. Otherwise, the RFC should
follow the established Change Management process for
that type of change – and the resolution should be
applied only when the change has been approved and
scheduled for release. In the meantime, the KEDB should
be used to help resolve quickly any further occurrences of
the incidents/problems that occur.

Note: There may be some problems for which a Business
Case for resolution cannot be justified (e.g. where the
impact is limited but the cost of resolution would be
extremely high). In such cases a decision may be taken to
leave the Problem Record open but to use a workaround
description in the Known Error Record to detect and
resolve any recurrences quickly. Care should be taken to
use the appropriate code to flag the open Problem Record
so that it does not count against the performance of the
team performing the process and so that unauthorized
rework does not take place.

4.4.5.9 Problem Closure
When any change has been completed (and successfully
reviewed), and the resolution has been applied, the
Problem Record should be formally closed – as should any
related Incident Records that are still open. A check should
be performed at this time to ensure that the record
contains a full historical description of all events – and if
not, the record should be updated.

The status of any related Known Error Record should be
updated to shown that the resolution has been applied.

4.4.5.10 Major Problem Review
After every major problem (as determined by the
organization’s priority system), while memories are still
fresh a review should be conducted to learn any lessons
for the future. Specifically, the review should examine:

■ Those things that were done correctly
■ Those things that were done wrong
■ What could be done better in the future
■ How to prevent recurrence
■ Whether there has been any third-party responsibility

and whether follow-up actions are needed.

Such reviews can be used as part of training and
awareness activities for support staff – and any lessons
learned should be documented in appropriate procedures,
work instructions, diagnostic scripts or Known Error
Records. The Problem Manager facilitates the session and
documents any agreed actions.

The knowledge learned from the review should be
incorporated into a service review meeting with the
business customer to ensure the customer is aware of the
actions taken and the plans to prevent future major
incidents from occurring. This helps to improve customer
satisfaction and assure the business that Service
Operations is handling major incidents responsibly and
actively working to prevent their future recurrence.

Service Operation processes  |

4.4.5.11 Errors detected in the development
environment
It is rare for any new applications, systems or software
releases to be completely error-free. It is more likely that
during testing of such new applications, systems or
releases a prioritization system will be used to eradicate
the more serious faults, but it is possible that minor faults
are not rectified – often because of the balance that has to
be made between delivering new functionality to the
business as quickly as possible and ensuring totally fault-
free code or components.

Where a decision is made to release something into the
production environment that includes known deficiencies,
these should be logged as Known Errors in the KEDB,
together with details of workarounds or resolution
activities. There should be a formal step in the testing
sign-off that ensures that this handover always takes place
(see Service Transition publication).

Experience has shown if this does not happen, it will lead
to far higher support costs when the users start to
experience the faults and raise incidents that have to be
re-diagnosed and resolved all over again!

4.4.6 Triggers, input and output/inter-
process interfaces
The vast majority of Problem Records will be triggered in
reaction to one or more incidents, and many will be raised
or initiated via Service Desk staff. Other Problem Records,
and corresponding Known Error Records, may be triggered
in testing, particularly the latter stages of testing such as
User Acceptance Testing/Trials (UAT), if a decision is made
to go ahead with a release even though some faults are
known. Suppliers may trigger the need for some Problem
Records through the notification of potential faults or
known deficiencies in their products or services (e.g. a
warning may be given regarding the use of a particular CI
and a Problem Record may be raised to facilitate the
investigation by technical staff of the condition of such CIs
within the organization’s IT Infrastructure).

The primary relationship between Incident and Problem
Management has been discussed in detail in paragraphs
4.2.6 and 4.4.5.1. Other key interfaces include the
following:

■ Service Transition

● Change Management: Problem Management

ensures that all resolutions or workarounds that
require a change to a CI are submitted through
Change Management through an RFC. Change
Management will monitor the progress of these

changes and keep Problem Management advised.
Problem Management is also involved in rectifying
the situation caused by failed changes.
● Configuration Management: Problem

Management uses the CMS to identify faulty CIs
and also to determine the impact of problems and
resolutions. The CMS can also be used to form the
basis for the KEDB and hold or integrate with the
Problem Records.

● Release and Deployment Management: Is

responsible for rolling problem fixes out into the
live environment. It also assists in ensuring that the
associated known errors are transferred from the
development Known Error Database into the live
Known Error Database. Problem Management will
assist in resolving problems caused by faults during
the release process.

■ Service Design

● Availability Management: Is involved with

determining how to reduce downtime and increase
uptime. As such, it has a close relationship with
Problem Management, especially the proactive
areas. Much of the management information
available in Problem Management will be
communicated to Availability Management.

● Capacity Management: Some problems will

require investigation by Capacity Management
teams and techniques, e.g. performance issues.
Capacity Management will also assist in assessing
proactive measures. Problem Management provides
management information relative to the quality of
decisions made during the Capacity Planning
process.

● IT Service Continuity: Problem Management acts

as an entry point into IT Service Continuity
Management where a significant problem is not
resolved before it starts to have a major impact on
the business.

■ Continual Service Improvement

● Service Level Management: The occurrence of

incidents and problems affects the level of service
delivery measured by SLM. Problem Management
contributes to improvements in service levels, and
its management information is used as the basis of
some of the SLA review components. SLM also
provides parameters within which Problem
Management works, such as impact information
and the effect on services of proposed resolutions
and proactive measures.

66

| Service Operation processes

■ Service Strategy

● Financial Management: Assists in assessing the

impact of proposed resolutions or workarounds, as
well as Pain Value Analysis. Problem Management
provides management information about the cost
of resolving and preventing problems, which is
used as input into the budgeting and accounting
systems and Total Cost of Ownership calculations.

4.4.7 Information Management

4.4.7.1 CMS
The CMS will hold details of all of the components of the
IT Infrastructure as well as the relationships between these
components. It will act as a valuable source for problem
diagnosis and for evaluating the impact of problems (e.g.
if this disk is down, what data is on that disk; which
services use that data; which users use those services?). 
As it will also hold details of previous activities, it can also
be used as a valuable source of historical data to help
identify trends or potential weaknesses – a key part of
proactive Problem Management (see Continual Service
Improvement publication).

4.4.7.2 Known Error Database
The purpose of a Known Error Database is to allow storage
of previous knowledge of incidents and problems – and
how they were overcome – to allow quicker diagnosis and
resolution if they recur.

The Known Error Record should hold exact details of the
fault and the symptoms that occurred, together with
precise details of any workaround or resolution action that
can be taken to restore the service and/or resolve the
problem. An incident count will also be useful to
determine the frequency with which incidents are likely to
recur and influence priorities, etc.

It should be noted that a Business Case for a permanent
resolution for some problems may not exist. For example,
if a problem does not cause serious disruption and a
workaround exists and/or the cost of resolving the
problem far outweighs the benefits of a permanent
resolution – then a decision may be taken to tolerate the
existence of the problem. However, it will still be desirable

to diagnose and implement a workaround as quickly as
possible, which is where the KEDB can be of assistance.

It is essential that any data put into the database can be
quickly and accurately retrieved. The Problem Manager
should be fully trained and familiar with the search
methods/algorithms used by the selected database and
should carefully ensure that when new records are added,
the relevant search key criteria are correctly included.

Care should be taken to avoid duplication of records (i.e.
the same problem described in two or more ways as
separate records). To avoid this, the Problem Manager
should be the only person able to enter a new record.
Other support groups should be allowed, indeed
encouraged, to propose new records, but these should be
vetted by the Problem Manager before entry to the KEDB.
In large organizations where Problem Management staff
exist in multiple locations but a single KEDB is used
(recommended!), a procedure must be agreed between all
Problem Management staff to ensure that such duplication
cannot occur. This may involve designating just one staff
member as the central KEDB Manager.

The KEDB should be used during the Incident and
Problem Diagnosis phases to try to speed up the
resolution process – and new records should be added as
quickly as possible when a new problem has been
identified and diagnosed.

All support staff should be fully trained and conversant
with the value that the KEDB can offer and the way it
should be used. They should be able readily to retrieve
and use data.

Note: Some tools/implementations may choose to
delineate Known Errors simply by changing a field in the
original Problem Record. This is acceptable provided the
same level of functionality is available.

The KEDB, like the CMS, forms part of a larger Service
Knowledge Management System (SKMS) illustrated in
Figure 4.6. More information on the SKMS can be found in
the Service Transition publication.

4.4.8 Metrics
The following metrics should be used to judge the
effectiveness and efficiency of the Problem Management
process, or its operation:

■ The total number of problems recorded in the period

(as a control measure)

■ The percentage of problems resolved within SLA

targets (and the percentage that are not!)

■ The number and percentage of problems that

exceeded their target resolution times

■ The backlog of outstanding problems and the trend

(static, reducing or increasing?)

■ The average cost of handling a problem
■ The number of major problems (opened and closed

and backlog)

■ The percentage of Major Problem Reviews successfully

performed

■ The number of Known Errors added to the KEDB
■ The percentage accuracy of the KEDB (from audits of

the database)

■ The percentage of Major Problem Reviews completed

successfully and on time.

All metrics should be broken down by category, impact,
severity, urgency and priority level and compared with
previous periods.

4.4.9 Challenges, Critical Success Factors
and risks
A major dependency for Problem Management is the
establishment of an effective Incident Management
process and tools. This will ensure that problems are
identified as soon as possible and that as much work is
done on pre-qualification as possible. However, it is also
critical that the two processes have formal interfaces and
common working practices. This implies the following:

■ Linking Incident and Problem Management tools
■ The ability to relate Incident and Problem Records
■ The second- and third-line staff should have a good

working relationship with staff on the first line

■ Making sure that business impact is well understood

by all staff working on problem resolution.

68

| Service Operation processes

In addition it is important that Problem Management is
able to use all Knowledge and Configuration Management
resources available.

■ There is less likelihood of errors being made in data

entry or in the use of a critical service by an unskilled
user (e.g. production control systems)

Another CSF is the ongoing training of technical staff in
both technical aspects of their job as well as the business
implications of the services they support and the
processes they use.

4.5 ACCESS MANAGEMENT

Access Management is the process of granting authorized
users the right to use a service, while preventing access to
non-authorized users. It has also been referred to as Rights
Management or Identity Management in different
organizations.

4.5.1 Purpose/goal/objective
Access Management provides the right for users to be able
to use a service or group of services. It is therefore the
execution of policies and actions defined in Security and
Availability Management.

4.5.2 Scope
Access Management is effectively the execution of both
Availability and Information Security Management, in that
it enables the organization to manage the confidentiality,
availability and integrity of the organization’s data and
intellectual property.

Access Management ensures that users are given the right
to use a service, but it does not ensure that this access is
available at all agreed times – this is provided by
Availability Management.

Access Management is a process that is executed by all
Technical and Application Management functions and is
usually not a separate function. However, there is likely to
be a single control point of coordination, usually in IT
Operations Management or on the Service Desk.

Access Management can be initiated by a Service Request
through the Service Desk.

4.5.3 Value to business
Access Management provides the following value:

■ Controlled access to services ensures that the

organization is able to maintain more effectively the
confidentiality of its information

■ Employees have the right level of access to execute

their jobs effectively

■ The ability to audit use of services and to trace the

abuse of services

■ The ability more easily to revoke access rights when

needed – an important security consideration

■ May be needed for regulatory compliance (e.g. SOX,

HIPAA, COBIT).

4.5.4 Policies/principles/basic concepts
Access Management is the process that enables users to
use the services that are documented in the Service
Catalogue. It comprises the following basic concepts:

■ Access refers to the level and extent of a service’s
functionality or data that a user is entitled to use.
■ Identity refers to the information about them that

distinguishes them as an individual and which verifies
their status within the organization. By definition, the
Identity of a user is unique to that user. (This is
covered in more detail in paragraph 4.5.7.1.)

■ Rights (also called privileges) refer to the actual

settings whereby a user is provided access to a service
or group of services. Typical rights, or levels of access,
include read, write, execute, change, delete.

■ Services or service groups. Most users do not use

only one service, and users performing a similar set of
activities will use a similar set of services. Instead of
providing access to each service for each user
separately, it is more efficient to be able to grant each
user – or group of users – access to the whole set of
services that they are entitled to use at the same time.
(This is discussed in more detail in paragraph 4.5.7.2.)

■ Directory Services refers to a specific type of tool
that is used to manage access and rights. These are
discussed in section 5.8.

4.5.5 Process activities, methods and
techniques

4.5.5.1 Requesting access
Access (or restriction) can be requested using one of any
number of mechanisms, including:

■ A standard request generated by the Human Resource

system. This is generally done whenever a person is
hired, promoted, transferred or when they leave the
company

■ A Request for Change
■ A Service Request submitted via the Request

Fulfilment system

Service Operation processes  |

69

■ By executing a pre-authorized script or option (e.g.

downloading an application from a staging server as
and when it is needed).

Rules for requesting access are normally documented as
part of the Service Catalogue.

4.5.5.2 Verification
Access Management needs to verify every request for
access to an IT service from two perspectives:

■ That the user requesting access is who they say 

they are

■ That they have a legitimate requirement for 

that service.

The first category is usually achieved by the user providing
their username and password. Depending on the
organization’s security policies, the use of the username
and password are usually accepted as proof that the
person is a legitimate user. However, for more sensitive
services further identification may be required (biometric,
use of an electronic access key or encryption device, etc.).

The second category will require some independent
verification, other than the user’s request. For example:

■ Notification from Human Resources that the person is

a new employee and requires both a username and
access to a standard set of services

■ Notification from Human Resources that the user has

been promoted and requires access to additional
resources

■ Authorization from an appropriate (defined in the

process) manager

■ Submission of a Service Request (with supporting

evidence) through the Service Desk

■ Submission of an RFC (with supporting evidence)
through Change Management, or execution of a 
pre-defined Standard Change

■ A policy stating that the user may have access to an

optional service if they need it.

For new services the Change Record should specify which
users or groups of users will have access to the Service.
Access Management will then check to see that all the
users are still valid and automatically provide access as
specified in the RFC.

4.5.5.3 Providing rights
Access Management does not decide who has access to
which IT services. Rather, Access Management executes
the policies and regulations defined during Service
Strategy and Service Design. Access Management enforces

decisions to restrict or provide access, rather than making
the decision.

As soon as a user has been verified, Access Management
will provide that user with rights to use the requested
service. In most cases this will result in a request to every
team or department involved in supporting that service to
take the necessary action. If possible, these tasks should
be automated.

The more roles and groups that exist, the more likely that
Role Conflict will arise. Role Conflict in this context refers
to a situation where two specific roles or groups, if
assigned to a single user, will create issues with separation
of duties or conflict of interest. Examples of this include:

■ One role requires detailed access, while another role

prevents that access

■ Two roles allow a user to perform two tasks that

should not be combined (e.g. a contractor can log
their time sheet for a project and then approve all
payment on work for the same project).

Role Conflict can be avoided by careful creation of roles
and groups, but more often they are caused by policies
and decisions made outside of Service Operation – either
by the business or by different project teams working
during Service Design. In each case the conflict must be
documented and escalated to the stakeholders to resolve.

Whenever roles and groups are defined, it is possible that
they could be defined too broadly or too narrowly. There
will always be users who need something slightly different
from the pre-defined roles. In these cases, it is possible to
use standard roles and then add or subtract specific rights
as required – similar to the concept of Baselines and
Variants in Configuration Management (see Service
Transition publication). However, the decision to do this is
not in the hands of individual operational staff members.
Each exception should be coordinated by Access
Management and approved through the originating
process.

Access Management should perform a regular review of
the roles and groups that it has created and manage to
ensure that they are appropriate for the services that IT
delivers and supports – and obsolete or unwanted
roles/groups should be removed.

4.5.5.4 Monitoring identity status
As users work in the organization, their roles change and
so also do their needs to access services. Examples of
changes include:

70

| Service Operation processes

■ Job changes. In this case the user will possibly need

access to different or additional services.

this information available to all who have access to the
Incident Management system will expose vulnerabilities.

■ Promotions or demotions. The user will probably use

the same set of services, but will need access to
different levels of functionality or data.

■ Transfers. In this situation, the user may need access
to exactly the same set of services, but in a different
region with different working practices and different
sets of data.

■ Resignation or death. Access needs to be completely

removed to prevent the username being used as a
security loophole.

■ Retirement. In many organizations, an employee who
retires may still have access to a limited set of services,
including benefits systems or systems that allow them
to purchase company products at a reduced rate.

■ Disciplinary action. In some cases the organization

will require a temporary restriction to prevent the user
from accessing some or all of the services that they
would normally have access to. There should be a
feature in the process and tools to do this, rather than
having to delete and reinstate the user’s access rights.

■ Dismissals. Where an employee or contractor is

dismissed, or where legal action is taken against a
customer (for example for defaulting on payment for
products purchased on the Internet), access should be
revoked immediately. In addition, Access Management,
working together with Information Security
Management, should take active measures to prevent
and detect malicious action against the organization
from that user.

Access Management should understand and document
the typical User Lifecycle for each type of user and use it
to automate the process. Access Management tools should
provide features that enable a user to be moved from one
state to another, or from one group to another, easily and
with an audit trail.

4.5.5.5 Logging and tracking access
Access Management should not only respond to requests.
It is also responsible for ensuring that the rights that they
have provided are being properly used.

In this respect, Access Monitoring and Control must be
included in the monitoring activities of all Technical and
Application Management functions and all Service
Operation processes.

Exceptions should be handled by Incident Management,
possibly using Incident Models specifically designed to
deal with abuse of access rights. It should be noted that
the visibility of such actions should be restricted. Making

Information Security Management plays a vital role in
detecting unauthorized access and comparing it with the
rights that were provided by Access Management. This will
require Access Management involvement in defining the
parameters for use in Intrusion Detection tools.

Access Management may also be required to provide a
record of access for specific Services during forensic
investigations. If a user is suspected of breaches of policy,
inappropriate use of resources, or fraudulent use of data,
Access Management may be required to provide evidence
of dates, times and even content of that user’s access to
specific Services. This is normally provided by the
Operational staff of that service, but working as part of the
Access Management process.

4.5.5.6 Removing or restricting rights
Just as Access Management provides rights to use a
Service, it is also responsible for revoking those rights.
Again, this is not a decision that it makes on its own.
Rather, it will execute the decisions and policies made
during Service Strategy and Design and also decisions
made by managers in the organization.

Removing access is usually done in the following
circumstances:

■ Death
■ Resignation
■ Dismissal
■ When the user has changed roles and no longer

requires access to the service

■ Transfer or travel to an area where different regional

access applies.

In other cases it is not necessary to remove access, but
just to provide tighter restrictions. These could include
reducing the level, time or duration of access. Situations 
in which access should be restricted include:

■ When the user has changed roles or been demoted

and no longer requires the same level of access

■ When the user is under investigation, but still requires

access to basic services, such as e-mail. In this case
their e-mail may be subject to additional scanning
(but this would need to be handled very carefully 
and in full accordance with the organization’s 
security policy)

■ When a user is away from the organization on

temporary assignment and will not require access to
that service for some time.

Service Operation processes  |

71

4.5.6 Triggers, input and output/inter-
process interfaces
Access Management is triggered by a request for a user or
users to access a service or group of services. This could
originate from any of the following:

■ An RFC. This is most frequently used for large-scale

service introductions or upgrades where the rights of a
significant number of users need to be updated as
part of the project.

■ A Service Request. This is usually initiated through

the Service Desk, or directly into the Request
Fulfilment system, and executed by the relevant
Technical or Application Management teams.

■ A request from the appropriate Human Resources

Management personnel (which should be channelled
via the Service Desk). This is usually generated as part
of the process for hiring, promoting, relocating and
termination or retirement.

■ A request from the manager of a department, who
could be performing an HR role, or who could have
made a decision to start using a service for the first
time.

Access Management should be linked to the Human
Resource processes to verify the user’s identify as well as
to ensure that they are entitled to the services being
requested.

4.5.7 Information Management

4.5.7.1 Identity
The identity of a user is the information about them that
distinguishes them as an individual and which verifies
their status within the organization. By definition, the
identity of a user is unique to that user. Since there are
cases where two users share a common piece of
information (e.g. they have the same name), identity is
usually established using more than one piece of
information, for example:

■ Name
■ Address
■ Contact details, e.g. telephone, e-mail address, etc.
■ Physical documentation, e.g. driver’s licence, passport,

marriage certificate, etc.

■ Numbers that refer to a document or an entry in a

database, e.g. employee number, tax number,
government identity number, driver’s licence number,
etc.

■ Biometric information, e.g. fingerprints, retinal images,

voice recognition patterns, DNA, etc.

■ Expiration date (if relevant).

A user identity is provided to anyone with a legitimate
requirement to access IT services or organizational
information. These could include:

Information Security Management is a key driver for Access
Management as it will provide the security and data
protection policies and tools needed to execute Access
Management.

■ Employees
■ Contractors
■ Vendor staff (e.g. account managers, support

personnel, etc.)

Change Management plays an important role as the
means to control the actual requests for access. This is
because any request for access to a service is a change,
although it is usually processed as a Standard Change or
Service Request (possibly using a model) once the criteria
for access have been agreed through SLM.

SLM maintains the agreements for access to each service.
This will include the criteria for who is entitled to access
each service, what the cost of that access will be, if
appropriate and what level of access will be granted to
different types of user (e.g. managers or staff).

There is also a strong relationship between Access
Management and Configuration Management. The CMS
can be used for data storage and interrogated to
determine current access details.

■ Customers (especially when purchasing products or

services over the Internet).

Most organizations will verify a user’s identity before they
join the organization by requesting a subset of the above
information. The more secure the organization, the more
types of information are required and the more thoroughly
they are checked.

Many organizations will be faced with the need to provide
access rights to temporary or occasional staff or
contractors/suppliers. The management of access to such
personnel often proves problematic – closing access after
use is often as difficult to manage, or more so, than
providing access initially. Well-defined procedures
between IT and HR should be established that include fail-
safe checks that ensure access rights are removed
immediately they are no longer justified or required.

When a user is granted access to an application, it should
already have been established by the organization (usually

72

| Service Operation processes

the Human Resources or Security Department) that the
user is who they say they are.

and protected as part of the organization’s security
procedures.

At this point, all that information is filed and the file is
associated with a corporate identity, usually an employee
or contractor number and an identity that can be used to
access corporate resources and information, usually a user
identity or ‘username’ and an associated password.

4.5.7.2 Users, groups, roles and service groups
While each user has an individual identity, and each IT
service can be seen as an entity in its own right, it is often
helpful to group them together so that they can be
managed more easily. Sometimes the terms ‘user profile’
or ‘user template’ or ‘user role’ are used to describe this
type of grouping.

Most organizations have a standard set of services for all
individual users, regardless of their position or job
(excluding customers – who do not have any visibility to
internal services and processes). These will include services
such as messaging, office automation, Desktop Support,
telephony, etc. New users are automatically provided with
rights to use these services.

However, most users also have some specialized role that
they perform. For example, in addition to the standard
services, the user also performs a Marketing Management
role, which requires that they have access to some
specialized marketing and financial modelling tools 
and data.

Some groups may have unique requirements – such as
field or home workers who may have to dial in or use
Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections, with security
implications that may have to be more tightly managed.

To make it easier for Access Management to provide the
appropriate rights, it uses a catalogue of all the roles in
the organization and which services support each role.
This catalogue of roles should be compiled and
maintained by Access Management in conjunction with
HR and will often be automated in the Directory Services
tools (see section 5.8).

In addition to playing different roles, users may also
belong to different groups. For example, all contractors are
required to log their timesheets in a dedicated Time Card
System, which is not used by employees. Access
Management will assess all the roles that a user plays as
well as the groups that they belong to and ensure that
they provide rights to use all associated services.

Note: All data held on users will be subject to data
protection legislation (this exists in most geographic
locations in some form or other) so should be handled

4.5.8 Metrics
Metrics that can be used to measure the efficiency and
effectiveness of Access Management include:

■ Number of requests for access (Service Request, RFC,

etc.)

■ Instances of access granted, by service, user,

department, etc.

■ Instances of access granted by department or

individual granting rights

■ Number of incidents requiring a reset of access rights
■ Number of incidents caused by incorrect access

settings.

4.5.9 Challenges, Critical Success Factors
and risks
Conditions for successful Access Management include:

■ The ability to verify the identity of a user (that the

person is who they say they are)

■ The ability to verify the identity of the approving

person or body

■ The ability to verify that a user qualifies for access to a

specific service

■ The ability to link multiple access rights to an

individual user

■ The ability to determine the status of the user at any

time (e.g. to determine whether they are still
employees of the organization when they log on to a
system)

■ The ability to manage changes to a user’s access

requirements

■ The ability to restrict access rights to unauthorized

users

■ A database of all users and the rights that they have

been granted.

4.6 OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES OF
PROCESSES COVERED IN OTHER LIFECYCLE
PHASES

4.6.1 Change Management
Change Management is primarily covered in the Service
Transition publication, but there are some aspects of
Change Management which Service Operation staff will be
involved with on a day-to-day basis. These include:

Service Operation processes  |

73

■ Raising and submitting RFCs as needed to address

■ Participation in the planning stages of major new

Service Operation issues

releases to advise on Service Operation issues

■ Participating in CAB or CAB/EC meetings to ensure

■ The physical handling of CIs from/to the DML as

that Service Operation risks, issues and views are taken
into account

■ Implementing changes as directed by Change

Management where they involve Service Operation
component or services

■ Backing out changes as directed by Change

Management where they involve Service Operation
component or services

■ Helping define and maintain change models relating

to Service Operation components or services

■ Receiving change schedules and ensuring that all

Service Operation staff are made aware of and
prepared for all relevant changes

■ Using the Change Management process for standard,

operational-type changes.

4.6.2 Configuration Management
Configuration Management is primarily covered in the
Service Transition publication, but there are some aspects
of Configuration Management which Service Operation
staff will be involved with on a day-to-day basis. These
include:

■ Informing Configuration Management of any

discrepancies found between any CIs and the CMS
■ Making any amendments necessary to correct any
discrepancies, under the authority of Configuration
Management, where they involve any Service
Operation components or services.

Responsibility for updating the CMS remains with
Configuration Management, but in some cases Operations
staff might be asked, under the direction of Configuration
Management, to update relationships, or even to add new
CIs or mark CIs as ‘disposed’ in the CMS, if these updates
are related to operational activities actually performed by
Operations staff.

4.6.3 Release and Deployment Management
Release and Deployment Management is primarily covered
in the Service Transition publication, but there are some
aspects of this process which Service Operation staff will
be involved with on a day-to-day basis. These may
include:

■ Actual implementation actions regarding the

deployment of new releases, under the direction of
Release and Deployment Management, where they
relate to Service Operation components or services

required to fulfil their operational roles – while
adhering to relevant Release and Deployment
Management procedures, such as ensure that all items
are properly booked out and back in.

4.6.4 Capacity Management
Capacity Management should operate at three levels:
Business Capacity Management, Service Capacity
Management and Component Capacity Management.

■ Business Capacity Management involves working

with the business to plan and anticipate both longer-
term strategic issues and shorter-term tactical
initiatives that are likely to have an impact on IT
capacity.

■ Service Capacity Management is about

understanding the characteristics of each of the IT
services, and then the demands that different types 
of users or transactions have on the underlying
infrastructure – and how these vary over time and
might be impacted by business change.

■ Component Capacity Management involves

understanding the performance characteristics and
capabilities and current utilization levels of all the
technical components (CIs) that make up the IT
Infrastructure, and predicting the impact of any
changes or trends.

Many of these activities are of a strategic or longer-term
planning nature and are covered in the Service Strategy,
Service Design and Service Transition publications.
However, there are a number of operational Capacity
Management activities that must be performed on a
regular ongoing basis as part of Service Operation. These
include the following.

4.6.4.1 Capacity and Performance Monitoring
All components of the IT Infrastructure should be
continually monitored (in conjunction with Event
Management) so that any potential problems or trends
can be identified before failures or performance
degradation occurs. Ideally, such monitoring should be
automated and thresholds should be set so that exception
alerts are raised in good time to allow appropriate
avoiding or recovery action to be taken before adverse
impact occurs.

The components and elements to be monitored will vary
depending upon the infrastructure in use, but will typically
include:

74

| Service Operation processes

■ CPU utilization (overall and broken down by

system/service usage)

■ Memory utilization
■ IO rates (physical and buffer) and device utilization
■ Queue length (maximum and average)
■ File store utilization (disks, partitions, segments)
■ Applications (throughput rates, failure rates)
■ Databases (utilization, record locks, indexing,

contention)

■ Network transaction rates, error and retry rates
■ Transaction response time
■ Batch duration profiles
■ Internet/intranet site/page hit rates
■ Internet response times (external and internal to

firewalls)

■ Number of system/application log-ons and concurrent

users

■ Number of network nodes in use, and utilization

levels.

There are different kinds of monitoring tools needed to
collect and interpret data at each level. For example, some
tools will allow performance of business transactions to be
monitored, while others will monitor CI behaviour.

Capacity Management must set up and calibrate alarm
thresholds (where necessary in conjunction with Event
Management, as it is often Event Monitoring tools that
may be used) so that the correct alert levels are set and
that any filtering is established as necessary so that only
meaningful events are raised. Without such filtering it is
possible that ‘information only’ alerts can obscure more
significant alerts that require immediate attention. In
addition, it is possible for serious failures to cause ‘alert
storms’ due to very high volumes of repeat alerts, which
again must be filtered so that the most meaningful
messages are not obscured.

It may be appropriate to use external, third-party,
monitoring capabilities for some CIs or components of 
the IT Infrastructure (e.g. key internet sites/pages). 
Capacity Management should be involved in helping
specify and select any such monitoring capabilities and 
in integrating the results or any alerts with other
monitoring and handling systems.

Capacity Management must work with all appropriate
support groups to make decisions on where alarms are
routed and on escalation paths and timescales. Alerts
should be logged to the Service Desk as well as to
appropriate support staff, so that appropriate Incident
Records can be raised so a permanent record of the event
exists – and Service Desk staff have a view of how well the

support group(s) are dealing with the fault and can
intervene if necessary.

Manufacturers’ claimed performance capabilities and
agreed service level targets, together with actual historical
monitored performance and capacity data, should be used
to set alert levels. This may need to be an iterative process
initially, performing some trial-and-error adjustments until
the correct levels are achieved.

Note: Capacity Management may have to become
involved in the capacity requirements and capabilities of IT
Service Management. Whether the organization has
enough Service Desk staff to handle the rate of incidents;
whether the CAB structure can handle the number of
changes it is being asked to review and approve; whether
support tools can handle the volume of data being
gathered are Capacity Management issues, which the
Capacity Management team may be asked to help
investigate and answer.

4.6.4.2 Handling capacity- or performance-
related incidents
If an alert is triggered, or an incident is raised at the
Service Desk, caused by a current or ongoing Capacity or
Performance Management problem, Capacity Management
must become involved to identify the cause and find a
resolution. Working together with appropriate technical
support groups, and alongside Problem Management, all
necessary investigations must be performed to detect
exactly what has gone wrong and what is needed to
correct the situation.

It may be necessary to switch to more detailed monitoring
during the investigation phase to determine the exact
cause. Monitoring is often set at a ‘background’ level
during normal circumstances due to the large amount of
data that can be generated and to avoid placing too high
a burden on the IT Infrastructure – but when specific
difficulties are being investigated more detailed
monitoring may be needed to pinpoint the exact cause.

When a solution, or potential solution, has been found,
any changes necessary to resolve the problem must be
approved via formal Change Management prior to
implementation. If the fault is causing serious disruption
and an urgent resolution is needed, the urgent change
process should be used. It is very important that no
‘tuning’ takes place without submission through Change
Management, as even apparently small adjustments can
often have very large cumulative effects – sometimes
across the entire IT Infrastructure.

Service Operation processes  |

4.6.4.3 Capacity and performance trends
Capacity Management has a role to play in identifying any
capacity or performance trends as they become
discernible. Further details of actions needed to address
such trends are included in the Continual Service
Improvement publication.

4.6.4.4 Storage of Capacity Management data
Large amounts of data are usually generated through
capacity and performance monitoring. Monitoring of
meters and tables of just a few Kbytes each can quickly
grown into huge files if many components are being
monitored at relatively short intervals. Another problem
with very short-term monitoring is that it is not possible to
gather meaningful information without looking over a
longer period. For example, a single snapshot of a CPU
will show the device to be either ‘busy’ or ‘idle’ – but a
summary over, say, a 5-minute period will show the
average utilization level over that period, which is a much
more meaningful measure of whether the device is able to
work comfortably, or whether potential performance
problems are likely to occur.

In any organization it is likely that the monitoring tools
used will vary greatly – with a combination of system-
specific tools, many of them part of the basic operating
system, and specialist monitoring tools being used. In
order to coordinate the data being generated and allow
the retention of meaningful data for analysis and trending
purposes, some form of central repository for holding 
this summary data is needed: a Capacity Management
Information System (CMIS).

The format, location and design of such a database should
be planned and implemented in advance – see the Service
Design publication for further details – but there will be
some operational aspects to handle, such as database
housekeeping and backups.

4.6.4.5 Demand Management
Demand Management is the name given to a number of
techniques that can be used to modify demand for a
particular resource or service. Some techniques for
Demand Management can be planned in advance – and
these are covered in more detail in the Service Design
publication. However, there are other aspects of Demand
Management that are of a more operational nature,
requiring shorter-term action.

If, for example, the performance of a particular service is
causing concern, and short-term restrictions on
concurrency of users are needed to allow performance
improvements for a smaller restricted group, then Service

Operation functions will have to take action to implement
such restrictions – usually accompanied by concurrent
action to implement the logging-out of users who have
been inactive for an agreed period of time to free up
resources for others.

4.6.4.6 Workload Management
There may be occasions when optimization of
infrastructure resources is needed to maintain or improve
performance or throughput. This can often be done
through Workload Management, which is a generic term
to cover such actions as:

■ Rescheduling a particular service or workload to run at

a different time of day, or day of the week etc.
(usually away from peak-times to off-peak windows) –
which will often mean having to make adjustments to
job-scheduling software.

■ Moving a service or workload from one location or set

of CIs to another – often to balance utilization or
traffic.

■ Technical Virtualization: setting up and using
virtualization systems to allow movement of
processing around the infrastructure to give better
performance/resilience in a dynamic fashion.

■ Limiting or moving demand for resources through

Demand Management techniques (see above and also
the Service Design publication).

It will only be possible to manage workloads effectively if
a good understanding exists of which workloads will run
at what time and how much resource utilization each
workload places upon the IT Infrastructure. Diligent
monitoring and analysis of workloads is therefore needed
on an ongoing operational basis.

4.6.4.7 Modelling and applications sizing
Modelling and/or sizing of new services and/or
applications must, where appropriate, be done during the
planning and transition phases – see the Service Design
and Service Transition publications. However, the Service
Operation functions have a role to play in evaluating the
accuracy of the predictions and feeding back any issues or
discrepancies.

4.6.4.8 Capacity Planning
During Service Design and Service Transition, the capacity
requirements of IT services are calculated. A forward-
looking capacity plan should be maintained and regularly
updated and Service Operation will have a role to play in
this. Such a plan should look forward up to two years or

76

| Service Operation processes

more, but should be reviewed regularly every three to 12
months, depending upon volatility and resources available.

available to the specified users at the required time and at
the agreed levels.

The plan should be linked to the organization’s financial
planning cycle, so that any required expenditure for
infrastructure upgrades, enhancements or additions can be
included in budget estimates and approved in advance.

During Service Operation the IT teams and users are in the
best position to detect whether services actually meet the
agreed requirements and whether the design of these
services is effective.

The plan should predict the future but must also examine
and report upon previous predictions, particularly to give
some confidence in further predictions. Where any
discrepancies have been encountered, these should be
explained and future remedial action described.

What seems like a good idea during the Design phase
may not actually be practical or optimal. The experience of
the users and operational functions makes them a primary
input into the ongoing improvement of existing services
and the design.

The Capacity Plan might typically cover:

■ Current performance and utilization details, with

recent trends for all key CIs, including
● Backbone networks
● LANs
● Mainframes (if still used)
● Key servers
● Main data storage devices
● Selected (representative) desktop and laptop

equipment

● Key websites
● Key databases
● Key applications
● Operational capacity – electricity, floor space,

environmental capacity (air condition), floor
weighting, heat generation and output, electrical
and water demand and supply etc.

● Magnetic media.

■ Estimated performance and utilization for all such CIs

during the planning period (e.g. the next three
months)

■ Comparative data with previous estimates – to allow

confidence in future estimates to be judged
■ Reports on any specific capacity difficulties

encountered in the past period, with details of
recovery and preventive actions taken for the future

■ Details of any required upgrades or procurements
needed and planned for the future, with indicative
costs and timescales.

■ Any potential capacity risks that are likely – with

suggested countermeasures should they arise.

4.6.5 Availability Management
During Service Design and Service Transition, IT services
are designed for availability and recovery. Service
Operation is responsible for actually making the IT service

However, there are a number of challenges with gaining
access to this knowledge:

■ Most of the experiences of the operational teams and

users are either informal, or spread across multiple
sources.

■ The process for collecting and collating this data

needs to be formalized.

■ Users and operational staff are usually fully occupied

with their regular activities and tasks and it is very
difficult for them to be involved in regular planning
and design activities. One argument often made here
is that if design is improved, the operational teams
will be less busy resolving problems and will therefore
have more time to be involved in design activities.
However, practice shows that as soon as staff are freed
up, they often become the target of workforce
reduction exercises.

Having said this, there are three key opportunities for
operational staff to be involved in Availability
Improvement, since these are generally viewed as part of
their ongoing responsibility:

■ Review of maintenance activities. Service Design

will define detailed maintenance schedules and
activities, which are required to keep IT services
functioning at the required level of performance and
availability. Regular comparison of actual maintenance
activities and times with the plans will highlight
potential areas for improvement. One of the sources of
this information is a review of whether Service
Maintenance Objectives were met and, if not, why not.
■ Major problem reviews. Problems could be the result
of any number of factors, one of which is poor design.
Problem reviews therefore may include opportunities
to identify improvements to the design of IT services,
which will include availability and capacity
improvement.

■ Involvement in specific initiatives using techniques

such as Service Failure Analysis (SFA), Component
Failure Impact Analysis (CFIA), or Fault Tree Analysis
(FTA) or as members of Technical Observation (TO)
activities – either as part of the follow-up to major
problems or as part of an ongoing Service
Improvement Plan, in collaboration with dedicated
Availability Management staff. These Availability
Management techniques are explained in more detail
in the Service Design publication.

There may be occasions when Operational Staff
themselves need downtime of one or more services to
enable them to conduct their operational or maintenance
activities – which may impact on availability if not
properly scheduled and managed. In such cases they must
liaise with SLM and Availability Management staff – who
will negotiate with the business/users, often using the
Service Desk to perform this role, to agree and schedule
such activities.

4.6.6 Knowledge Management
It is vitally important that all data and information that can
be useful for future Service Operation activities are
properly gathered, stored and assessed. Relevant data,
metrics and information should be passed up on the
management chain and to other Service Lifecycle phases
so that it can feed into the knowledge and wisdom layers
of the organization’s Service Knowledge Management
System, the structures of which have to be defined in
Service Strategy and Service Design and refined in
Continual Service Improvement (see other ITIL publications
in this series).

Key repositories of Service Operation, which have been
frequently mentioned elsewhere, are the CMS and the
KEDB, but this must be widened out to include all of the
Service Operation teams’ and departments’
documentation, such as operations manuals, procedures
manuals, work instructions, etc.

4.6.7 Financial Management for IT services
Service Operation staff must participate in and support the
overall IT budgeting and accounting system – and may 
be actively involved in any charging system that may be 
in place.

Proper planning is necessary so that capital expenditure
(Capex) and operational expenditure (Opex) budget
estimates can be prepared and agreed in good time to
meet the budgetary cycles.

Service Operation processes  |

77

The Service Operation Manager must also be involved in
regular, at least monthly, reviews of expenditure against
budgets – as part of the ongoing IT budgeting and
accounting process. Any discrepancies must be identified
and necessary adjustments made. All committed
expenditure must go through the organization’s purchase
order system so that commitments can be accrued and
proper checks must be made on all goods received so that
invoices and payments can be correctly authorized – or
discrepancies investigated and rectified.

It should be noted that some proposed cost reductions by
the business may actually increase IT costs, or at least unit
costs. Care should therefore be taken to ensure that IT is
involved in discussing all cost-saving measures and
contribute to overall decisions. Financial Management is
covered in detail in the Service Strategy publication.

4.6.8 IT Service Continuity Management
Service Operation functions are responsible for the testing
and execution of system and service recovery plans as
determined in the IT Service Continuity plans for the
organization. In addition, managers of all Service
Operation functions must be on the Business Continuity
Central Coordination team.

This is discussed in detail in Service Strategy and Service
Design and will not be repeated here, except to indicate
that it is important that Service Operation functions must
be involved in the following areas:

■ Risk assessment, using its knowledge of the

infrastructure and techniques such as CFIA and access
to information in the CMS to identify single points of
failure or other high-risk situations

■ Execution of any Risk Management measures that are

agreed, e.g. implementation of countermeasures, or
increased resilience to components of the
infrastructures, etc.

■ Assistance in writing the actual recovery plans for

systems and services under its control

■ Participation in testing of the plans (such as

involvement in off-site testing, simulations etc) on an
ongoing basis under the direction of the IT Service
Continuity Manager (ITSCM)

■ Ongoing maintenance of the plans under the control

of ITSCM and Change Management

■ Participation in training and awareness campaigns to

ensure that they are able to execute the plans and
understand their roles in a disaster

■ The Service Desk will play a key role in

communicating with staff, customers and users during
an actual disaster.

Chapter 4 dealt with the processes required for effective
Service Operation and Chapter 6 will deal with the
organizational aspects. This chapter focuses on a number
of operational activities that ensure that technology is
aligned with the overall Service and Process objectives.
These activities are sometimes described as processes, but
in reality they are sets of specialized technical activities all
aimed at ensuring that the technology required to deliver
and support services is operating effectively and efficiently.

These activities will usually be technical in nature –
although the exact technology will vary depending on the
type of services being delivered. This publication will focus
on the activities required to manage IT.

Important note on managing technology

It is tempting to divorce the concept of Service
Management from the management of the
infrastructure that is used to deliver those services.

In reality, it is impossible to achieve quality services
without aligning and ‘gearing’ every level of
technology (and the people who manage it) to the
services being provided. Service Management involves
people, process and technology.

In other words, the common Service Operation
activities are not about managing the technology for
the sake of having good technology performance. They
are about achieving performance that will integrate the
technology component with the people and process
components to achieve service and business objectives.
See Figure 5.1 for examples of how technology is
managed in maturing organizations.

Figure 5.1 illustrates the steps involved in maturing from a
technology-centric organization to an organization that
harnesses technology as part of its business strategy.
Figure 5.1 further outlines the role of Technology
Managers in organizations of differing maturity. The
diagram is not comprehensive, but it does provide
examples of the way in which technology is managed

in each type of organization. The bold headings indicate
the major role played by IT in managing technology. The
text in the rows describes the characteristics of an IT
department at each level.

The purpose of this diagram in this chapter is as follows:

■ This chapter focuses on Technical Management

activities, but there is no single way of representing
them. A less mature organization will tend to see
these activities as ends in themselves, not a means to
an end. A more mature organization will tend to
subordinate these activities to higher-level Service
Management objectives. For example, the Server
Management team will move from an insulated
department, focused purely on managing servers, 
to a team that works closely with other Technology
Managers to find ways of increasing their value 
to the business.

■ To make and reinforce the point that there is no ‘right’
way of grouping and organizing the departments that
perform these services. Some readers might interpret
the headings in this chapter as the names of
departments, but this is not the case. The aim of this
chapter is to identify the typical technical activities
involved in Service Operation. Organizational aspects
are discussed in Chapter 6.

■ The Service Operation activities described in the rest

of this chapter are not typical of any one of the levels
of maturity. Rather, the activities are usually all present
in some form at all levels. They are just organized and
managed differently at each level.

In some cases a dedicated group may handle all of a
process or activity while in other cases processes or
activities may be shared or split between groups.
However, by way of broad guidance, the following
sections list the required activities under the functional
groups most likely to be involved in their operation. This
does not mean that all organizations have to use these
divisions. Smaller organizations will tend to assign groups
of these activities (if they are needed at all) to single
departments, or even individuals.

Finally, the purpose of this chapter is not to provide a
detailed analysis of all the activities. They are specialized,
and detailed guidance is available from the platform
vendors and other, more technical, frameworks; new
categories will be added continually as technology
evolves. This chapter simply aims to highlight the
importance and nature of technology management for
Service Management in the IT context.

5.1 MONITORING AND CONTROL

The measurement and control of services is based on a
continual cycle of monitoring, reporting and subsequent
action. This cycle is discussed in detail in this section
because it is fundamental to the delivery, support and
improvement of services.

It is also important to note that, although this cycle takes
place during Service Operation, it provides a basis for
setting strategy, designing and testing services and
achieving meaningful improvement. It is also the basis for
SLM measurement. Therefore, although monitoring is
performed by Service Operation functions, it should not be
seen as a purely operational matter. All phases of the
Service Lifecycle should ensure that measures and controls
are clearly defined, executed and acted upon.

5.1.1 Definitions

Monitoring refers to the activity of observing a
situation to detect changes that happen over time.

In the context of Service Operation, this implies the
following:

■ Using tools to monitor the status of key CIs and key

operational activities

■ Ensuring that specified conditions are met (or not

met) and, if not, to raise an alert to the appropriate
group (e.g. the availability of key network devices)

■ Ensuring that the performance or utilization of a

component or system is within a specified range (e.g.
disk space or memory utilization)

■ To detect abnormal types or levels of activity in the

infrastructure (e.g. potential security threats)

■ To detect unauthorized changes (e.g. introduction of

software)

■ To ensure compliance with the organization’s policies

(e.g. inappropriate use of e-mail)

■ To track outputs to the business and ensure that they

meet quality and performance requirements

■ To track any information that is used to measure Key

Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Reporting refers to the analysis, production and
distribution of the output of the monitoring activity.

In the context of Service Operation, this implies the
following:

■ Using tools to collate the output of monitoring
information that can be disseminated to various
groups, functions or processes

■ Interpreting the meaning of that information
■ Determining where that information would best be

used

■ Ensuring that decision makers have access to the

information that will enable them to make decisions
■ Routing the reported information to the appropriate

person, group or tool.

Control refers to the process of managing the
utilization or behaviour of a device, system or service.
It is important to note, though, that simply
manipulating a device is not the same as controlling
it. Control requires three conditions:

■ The action must ensure that behaviour conforms

to a defined standard or norm

■ The conditions prompting the action must be

defined, understood and confirmed

■ The action must be defined, approved and

appropriate for these conditions.

In the context of Service Operation, control implies the
following:

■ Using tools to define what conditions represent

normal operations or abnormal operations

■ Regulate performance of devices, systems or services
■ Measure availability
■ Initiate corrective action, which could be automated

(e.g. reboot a device remotely or run a script), or
manual (e.g. notify operations staff of the status).

5.1.2 Monitor Control Loops
The most common model for defining control is the
Monitor Control Loop. Although it is a simple model, it has
many complex applications within IT Service Management.
This section will define the basic concepts of the Monitor
Control Loop Model and subsequent sections will show
how important these concepts are for the Service
Management Lifecycle. 

Figure 5.2 outlines the basic principles of control. A single
activity and its output are measured using a predefined
norm, or standard, to determine whether it is within an
acceptable range of performance or quality. If not, action
is taken to rectify the situation or to restore normal
performance.

Typically there are two types of Monitor Control Loops:

■ Open Loop Systems are designed to perform a

specific activity regardless of environmental conditions.
For example, a backup can be initiated at a given time

and frequency – and will run regardless of other
conditions.

■ Closed Loop Systems monitor an environment and

respond to changes in that environment. For example,
in network load balancing a monitor will evaluate the
traffic on a circuit. If network traffic exceeds a certain
range, the control system will begin to route traffic
across a backup circuit. The monitor will continue to
provide feedback to the control system, which will
continue to regulate the flow of network traffic
between the two circuits.

To help clarify the difference, solving Capacity
Management through over-provisioning is open loop; a
load-balancer that detects congestion/failure and redirects
capacity is closed loop.

5.1.2.1 Complex Monitor Control Loop
The Monitor Control Loop in Figure 5.2 is a good basis for
defining how Operations Management works, but within
the context of ITSM the situation is far more complex.
Figure 5.3 illustrates a process consisting of three major
activities. Each one has an input and an output, and the
output becomes an input for the next activity.

In this diagram, each activity is controlled by its own
Monitor Control Loop, using a set of norms for that
specific activity. The process as a whole also has its 
own Monitor Control Loop, which spans all the activities
and ensures that all norms are appropriate and are 
being followed.

Figure 5.3 Complex Monitor Control Loop

In Figure 5.3 there is a double feedback loop. One loop
focuses purely on executing a defined standard, and the
second evaluates the performance of the process and also
the standards whereby the process is executed. An
example of this would be if the first set of feedback loops
at the bottom of the diagram represented individual
stations on an assembly line and the higher-level loop
represented Quality Assurance.

The Complex Monitor Control Loop is a good
organizational learning tool (as defined by Chris Argyris
(1976, Increasing Leadership Effectiveness. New York: Wiley).
The first level of feedback at individual activity level is
concerned with monitoring and responding to data (single
facts, codes or pieces of information). The second level is
concerned with monitoring and responding to information
(a collection of a number of facts about which a
conclusion may be drawn). Refer to the Service Transition
publication for a full discussion on Data, Information,
Knowledge and Wisdom.

All of this is interesting theory, but does not explain how
the Monitor Control Loop concept can be used to operate
IT services. And especially – who defines the norm? Based

on what has been described so far, Monitor Control Loops
can be used to manage:

■ The performance of activities in a process or

procedure. Each activity and its related output can
potentially be measured to ensure that problems with
the process are identified before the process as a
whole is completed. For example, in Incident
Management, the Service Desk monitors whether a
technical team has accepted an incident in a specified
time. If not, the incident is escalated. This is done well
before the target resolution time for that incident
because the aim of escalating that one activity is to
ensure that the process as whole is completed in time.

■ The effectiveness of a process or procedure as a
whole. In this case the ‘activity’ box represents the
entire process as a single entity. For example, Change
Management will measure the success of the process
by checking whether a change was implemented on
time, to specification and within budget.

■ The performance of a device. For example, the

‘activity’ box could represent the response time of a
server under a given workload.

To define how to use the concept of Monitor Control
Loops in Service Management, the following questions
need to be answered:

■ How do we define what needs to be monitored?
■ What are the appropriate thresholds for each of these?
■ How will monitoring be performed (manual or

automated)?

■ What represents normal operation?
■ What are the dependencies for normal operation?
■ What happens before we get the input?
■ How frequently should the measurement take place?
■ Do we need to perform active measurement to check

whether the item is within the norm or do we wait
until an exception is reported (passive measurement)?

■ Is Operations Management the only function that

performs monitoring?

responsible for each loop?

The following sections will expand on the concept of
Monitor Control Loops and demonstrate how these
questions are answered.

5.1.2.2 The ITSM Monitor Control Loop
In ITSM, the complex Monitor Control Loop can be
represented as shown in Figure 5.4.

Figure 5.4 can be used to illustrate the control of a
process or of the components used to deliver a service. 
In this diagram the word ‘activity’ implies that it refers 
to a process. To apply it to a service, an ‘activity’ could
also be a ‘CI’. There are a number of significant features 
in Figure 5.4 as given overleaf.

| Common Service Operation activities

■ Each activity in a Service Management process (or

● Arrow 3. In this case the norms specified in

each component used to provide a service) is
monitored as part of the Service Operation processes.
The operational team or department responsible for
each activity or component will apply the Monitor
Control Loop as defined in the process, and using the
norms that were defined during the Service Design
processes. The role of Operational Monitoring and
Control is to ensure that the process or service
functions exactly as specified, which is why they are
primarily concerned with maintaining the status quo.
■ The norms and Monitoring and Control mechanisms
are defined in Service Design, but they are based on
the standards and architectures defined during Service
Strategy. Any changes to the organization’s Service
Strategy, architecture, service portfolios or Service
Level Requirements will precipitate changes to what is
monitored and how it is controlled.

■ The Monitor Control Loops are placed within the

context of the organization. This implies that Service
Strategy will primarily be executed by Business and IT
Executives with support from vendor account
managers. Service Design acts as the bridge between
Service Strategy and Service Operation and will
typically involve representatives from all groups. The
activities and controls will generally be executed by IT
staff (sometimes involving users) and supported by IT
Managers and the vendors. Service Improvement
spans all areas, but primarily represents the interests of
the business and its users.

■ Notice that the second level of monitoring in this

complex Monitor Control Loop is performed by the
CSI processes through Service Strategy and Service
Design. These relationships are represented by the
numbered arrows in Figure 5.4 as follows:
● Arrow 1. In this case CSI has recognized that the
service will be improved by making a change to
the Service Strategy. This could be the result of the
business needing a change to the Service Portfolio,
or that the architecture does not deliver what was
expected.

● Arrow 2. In this case the Service Level

Requirements need to be adjusted. It could be that
the service is too expensive; or that the
configuration of the infrastructure needs to be
changed to enhance performance; or because
Operations Management is unable to maintain
service quality in the current architecture.

Service Design are not being adhered to. This
could be because they are not appropriate or
executable, or because of a lack of education or a
lack of communication. The norms and the lack of
compliance need to be investigated and action
taken to rectify the situation.

Service Transition provides a major set of checks and
balances in these processes. It does so as follows:

■ For new services, Service Transition will ensure that
the technical architectures are appropriate; and that
the Operational Performance Standards can be
executed. This in turn will ensure that the Service
Operation teams or departments are able to meet the
Service Level Requirements.

■ For existing services, Change Management will

manage any of the changes that are required as part
of a control (e.g. tuning) as well as any changes
represented by the arrows labelled 1, 2 and 3.
Although Service Transition does not define strategy
and design services per se, it provides coordination
and assurance that the services are working, and will
continue to work, as planned.

Why is this loop covered under Service
Operation?

Figure 5.4 represents Monitoring and Control for the
whole of IT Service Management. Some readers of the
Service Operation publication may feel that it should
be more suitably covered in the Service Strategy
publication.

However, Monitoring and Control can only effectively
be deployed when the service is operational. This
means that the quality of the entire set of IT Service
Management processes depends on how they are
monitored and controlled in Service Operation.

The implications of this are as follows:

■ Service Operation staff are not the only people 
with an interest in what is monitored and how
they are controlled.

■ While Service Operation is responsible for

monitoring and control of services and
components, they are acting as stewards of a very
important part of the set of ITSM Monitoring and
Control loops.

■ If Service Operation staff define and execute

Monitoring and Control procedures in isolation,
none of the Service Management processes or 

Common Service Operation activities  |

87

functions will be fully effective. This is because the
Service Operation functions will not support the
priorities and information requirements of the
other processes, e.g. attempting to negotiate an
SLA when the only data available is page-swap
rates on a server and detailed bandwidth
utilization of a network.

5.1.2.3 Defining what needs to be monitored
The definition of what needs to be monitored is based on
understanding the desired outcome of a process, device or
system. IT should focus on the service and its impact on
the business, rather than just the individual components of
technology. The first question that needs to be asked is
‘What are we trying to achieve?’.

5.1.2.4 Internal and External Monitoring and
Control
At the outset, it will become clear that there are two levels
of monitoring:

■ Internal Monitoring and Control: Most teams or

departments are concerned about being able to
execute effectively and efficiently the tasks that have
been assigned to them. Therefore, they will monitor
the items and activities that are directly under their
control. This type of monitoring and control focuses
on activities that are self-contained within that 
team or department. For example, the Service Desk
Manager will monitor the volume of calls to determine
how many staff need to be available to answer 
the telephone.

■ External Monitoring and Control: Although each
team or department is responsible for managing its
own area, they do not act independently. Every task
that they perform, or device that they manage, has an
impact on the success of the organization as a whole.
Each team or department will also be controlling
items and activities on behalf of other groups,
processes or functions. For example, the Server
Management team will monitor the CPU performance
on key servers and perform workload balancing so
that a critical application is able to stay within
performance thresholds set by Application
Management.

The distinction between Internal and External Monitoring
is an important one. If Service Operation focuses only on
Internal Monitoring, it will have very well-managed
infrastructure, but no way of understanding or influencing
the quality of services. If it focuses only on External

Monitoring, it will understand how poor the service quality
is, but will have no idea what is causing it or how to
change it.

In reality, most organizations have a combination of
Internal and External Monitoring, but in many cases these
are not linked. For example, the Server Management team
knows exactly how well the servers are performing and
the Service Level Manager knows exactly how the users
perceive the quality of service provided by the servers.
However, neither of them knows how to link these metrics
to define what level of server performance represents
good quality service. This becomes even more confusing
when server performance that is acceptable in the middle
of the month, is not acceptable at month-end.

5.1.2.5 Defining objectives for Monitoring and
Control
Many organizations start by asking the question ‘What are
we managing?’. This will invariably lead to a strong
Internal Monitoring System, with very little linkage to the
real outcome or service that is required by the business.

The more appropriate question is ‘What is the end result
of the activities and equipment that my team manages?’.
Therefore the best place to start, when defining what to
monitor, is to determine the required outcome.

The definition of Monitoring and Control objectives should
ideally start with the definition of the Service Level
Requirements documents (see Service Design publication).
These will specify how the customers and users will
measure the performance of the service, and are used as
input into the Service Design processes. During Service
Design, various processes will determine how the service
will be delivered and managed. For example, Capacity
Management will determine the most appropriate and
cost-effective way to deliver the levels of performance
required. Availability Management will determine how the
infrastructure can be configured to provide the fewest
points of failure.

If there is any doubt about the validity or completeness 
of objectives, the COBIT framework provides a
comprehensive, high-level set of objectives as a checklist.
More information on COBIT is provided in Appendix A of
this publication.

The Service Design Process will help to identify the
following sets of inputs for defining Operational
Monitoring and Control norms and mechanisms:

■ They will work with customers and users to determine

how the output of the service will be measured. This
will include measurement mechanisms, frequency and

Active versus Passive Monitoring
■ Active Monitoring refers to the ongoing

‘interrogation’ of a device or system to determine its
status. This type of monitoring can be resource
intensive and is usually reserved to proactively monitor
the availability of critical devices or systems; or as a
diagnostic step when attempting to resolve an
Incident or diagnose a problem.

■ Passive Monitoring is more common and refers to

generating and transmitting events to a ‘listening
device’ or monitoring agent. Passive Monitoring
depends on successful definition of events and
instrumentation of the system being monitored (see
section 4.1).

Reactive versus Proactive
■ Reactive Monitoring is designed to request or trigger
action following a certain type of event or failure. For
example, server performance degradation may trigger
a reboot, or a system failure will generate an incident.
Reactive monitoring is not only used for exceptions. It
can also be used as part of normal operations
procedures, for example a batch job completes
successfully, which prompts the scheduling system to
submit the next batch job.

■ Proactive Monitoring is used to detect patterns of

events which indicate that a system or service may be
about to fail. Proactive monitoring is generally used in
more mature environments where these patterns have
been detected previously, often several times.
Proactive Monitoring tools are therefore a means of
automating the experience of seasoned IT staff and
are often created through the Proactive Problem
Management process (see Continual Service
Improvement publication).

Please note that Reactive and Proactive Monitoring could
be active or passive, as per Table 5.1 overleaf.

sampling. This part of Service Design will focus
specifically on the Functional Requirements.

■ They will identify key CIs, how they should be
configured and what level of performance and
availability is required in order to meet the agreed
Service Levels.

■ They will work with the developers and vendors of 

the CIs that make up each service to identify any
constraints or limitations in those components.

■ All support and delivery teams and departments will
need to identify what information will help them to
execute their role effectively. Part of the Service
Design and development will be to instrument each
service so that it can be monitored to provide this
information, or so that it can generate meaningful
events.

All of this means that a very important part of defining
what Service Operation monitors and how it exercises
control is to identify the stakeholders of each service.

Stakeholders can be defined as anyone with an interest in
the successful delivery and receipt of IT services. Each
stakeholder will have a different perspective of what it will
take to deliver or receive an IT service. Service Operation
will need to understand each of these perspectives in
order to determine exactly what needs to be monitored
and what to do with the output.

Service Operation will therefore rely on SLM to define
exactly who these stakeholders are and how they
contribute to or use the service. This is discussed more
fully in the Service Design and Continual Service
Improvement publications.

Note on Internal and External Monitoring
Objectives

The required outcome could be internal or external to
the Service Operation functions, although it should
always be remembered that an internal action will
often have an external result. For example,
consolidating servers to make them easier to manage
may result in a cost saving, which will affect the SLM
negotiation and review cycle as well as the Financial
Management processes.

5.1.2.6 Types of monitoring
There are many different types of monitoring tool and
different situations in which each will be used. This section
focuses on some of the different types of monitoring that
can be performed and when they would be appropriate.

Common Service Operation activities  |

Table 5.1 Active and Passive Reactive and Proactive Monitoring

Active

Passive

Reactive

Used to diagnose which device is causing the failure
and under what conditions (e.g. ‘ping’ a device, or
run and track a sample transaction through a series
of devices)

Requires knowledge of the infrastructure topography
and the mapping of services to CIs

Detects and correlates event records to determine the
meaning of the events and the appropriate action (e.g.
a user logs in three times with the incorrect password,
which generates represents a security exception and is
escalated through Information Security Management
procedures)

Requires detailed knowledge of the normal operation 
of the infrastructure and services

Proactive

Used to determine the real-time status of a device,
system or service – usually for critical components
or following the recovery of a failed device to ensure
that it is fully recovered (i.e. is not going to cause
further incidents)

Event records are correlated over time to build trends
for Proactive Problem Management.

Patterns of events are defined and programmed into
correlation tools for future recognition

Continuous Measurement versus Exception-Based
Measurement
■ Continuous Measurement is focused on monitoring
a system in real time to ensure that it complies with a
performance norm (for example, an application server
is available for 99.9% of the agreed service hours). The
difference between Continuous Measurement and
Active Monitoring is that Active Monitoring does not
have to be continuous. However, as with Active
Monitoring, this is resource intensive and is usually
reserved for critical components or services. In most
cases the cost of the additional bandwidth and
processor power outweighs the benefit of continuous
measurement. In these cases monitoring will usually
be based on sampling and statistical analysis (e.g. the
system performance is reported every 30 seconds and
extrapolated to represent overall performance). In
these cases, the method of measurement will have to
be documented and agreed in the OLAs to ensure
that it is adequate to support the Service Reporting
Requirements (see Continual Service Improvement
publication).

■ Exception-Based Measurement does not measure

the real-time performance of a service or system, but
detects and reports against exceptions. For example,
an event is generated if a transaction does not
complete, or if a performance threshold is reached.
This is more cost-effective and easier to measure, but
could result in longer service outages. Exception-Based
Measurement is used for less critical systems or on
systems where cost is a major issue. It is also used
where IT tools are not able to determine the status or
quality of a service (e.g. if printing quality is part of
the service specification, the only way to measure this

is physical inspection – often performed by the user
rather than IT staff). Where Exception-Based
Measurement is used, it is important that both the
OLA and the SLA for that service reflect this, as service
outages are more likely to occur, and users are often
required to report the exception.

Performance versus output
There is an important distinction between the reporting
used to track the performance of components or teams or
department used to deliver a service and the reporting
used to demonstrate the achievement of service quality
objectives.

IT managers often confuse these by reporting to the
business on the performance of their teams or
departments (e.g. number of calls taken per Service Desk
Analyst), as if that were the same thing as quality of
service (e.g. incidents solved within the agreed time).

Performance Monitoring and metrics should be used
internally by the Service Management to determine
whether people, process and technology are functioning
correctly and to standard.

Users and customers would rather see reporting related to
the quality and performance of the service.

Although Service Operation is concerned with both types
of reporting, the primary concern of this publication is
Performance Monitoring, whereas monitoring of Service
Quality (or Output-Based Monitoring) will be discussed in
detail in the Continual Service Improvement publication.

90

| Common Service Operation activities

5.1.2.7 Monitoring in Test Environments
As with any IT Infrastructure, a Test Environment will 
need to define how it will use monitoring and control.
These controls are more fully discussed in the Service
Transition publication.

■ Monitoring the Test Environment itself: A Test

Environment consists of infrastructure, applications and
processes that have to be managed and controlled
just as any other environment. It is tempting to think
that the Test Environment does not need rigorous
monitoring and control because it is not a live
environment. However, this argument is not valid. If a
Test Environment is not properly monitored and
controlled, there is a danger of running the tests on
equipment that deviates from the standards defined in 
Service Design.

■ Monitoring items being tested: The results of testing

have to be accurately tracked and checked. Also it is
important that any monitoring tools that have been
built into new or changed services have to be tested
as well.

5.1.2.8 Reporting and action

‘A report alone creates awareness; a report with an
action plan achieves results.’

Reporting and dysfunction

Practical experience has shown that there is more
reporting in dysfunctional organizations than in
effective organizations. This is because reports are not
being used to initiate pre-defined action plans, but
rather:

■ to shift the blame for an incident

■ to try to find out who is responsible for making a

decision

■ as input to creating action plans for future

occurrences.

In dysfunctional organizations a lot of reports are
produced which no one has the time to look at or
query.

Monitoring without control is irrelevant and ineffective.
Monitoring should always be aimed at ensuring that
service and operational objectives are being met. This
means that unless there is a clear purpose for monitoring
a system or service, it should not be monitored.

This also means that when monitoring is defined, so too
should any required actions. For example, being able to
detect that a major application has failed is not sufficient.

The relevant Application Management team should also
have defined the exact steps that it will take when the
application fails.

In addition, it should also be recognized that action may
need to be taken by different people, for example a single
event (such as an application failure) may trigger action by
the Application Management team (to restore service), the
users (to initiate manual processing) and management (to
determine how this event can be prevented in future).

The implications of this principle are outlined in more
detail in relation to Event Management (see section 4.1).

5.1.2.9 Service Operation audits
Regular audits must be performed on the Service
Operation processes and activities to ensure:

■ They are being performed as intended
■ There is no circumvention
■ They are still fit for purpose, or to identify any

required changes or improvements.

Service Operation Managers may choose to perform such
audits themselves, but ideally some form of independent
element to the audits is preferable.

The organization’s internal IT audit team or department
may be asked to be involved or some organizations may
choose to engage third-party consultancy/audit/
assessment companies so that an entirely independent
expert view is obtained.

Service Operation audits are part of the ongoing
measurement that takes place as part of Continual Service
Improvement and are discussed in more detail in that
publication.

5.1.2.10 Measurement, metrics and KPIs
This section has focused primarily on the monitoring and
control as a basis for Service Operation. Other sections of
the publication have covered some basic metrics that
could be used to measure the effectiveness and efficiency
of a process.

Although this publication is not primarily about
measurement and metrics, it is important that
organizations using these guidelines have robust
measurement techniques and metrics that support the
objectives of their organization. This section is a summary
of these concepts.

Common Service Operation activities  |

91

Measurement

Measurement refers to any technique that is used to
evaluate the extent, dimension or capacity of an item
in relation to a standard or unit.

■ Extent refers to the degree of compliance or

completion (e.g. are all changes formally
authorized by the appropriate authority)

■ Dimension refers to the size of an item, e.g. the

number of incidents resolved by the Service Desk

■ Capacity refers to the total capability of an item,

for example maximum number of standard
transactions that can be processed by a server per
minute.

Measurement only becomes meaningful when it is
possible to measure the actual output or dimensions of a
system, function or process against a standard or desired
level, e.g. the server must be capable of processing a
minimum of 100 standard transactions per minute. This
needs to be defined in Service Design, and refined over
time through Continual Service Improvement, but the
measurement itself takes place during Service Operation.

Metrics

Metrics refer to the quantitative, periodic assessment
of a process, system or function, together with the
procedures and tools that will be used to make these
assessments and the procedures for interpreting them.

This definition is important because it not only specifies
what needs to be measured, but also how to measure it,
what the acceptable range of performance will be and
what action will need to be taken as a result of normal
performance or an exception. From this, it is clear that any
metric given in the previous section of this publication is a
very basic one and will need to be applied and expanded
within the context of each organization before it can be
effective.

Key Performance Indicators

A KPI refers to a specific, agreed level of performance
that will be used to measure the effectiveness of an
organization or process.

KPIs are unique to each organization and have to be
related to specific inputs, outputs and activities. They are
not generic or universal and thus have not been included
in this publication.

A further reason for not including them is the fact that
similar metrics can be used to achieve very different KPIs.
For example, one organization used the metric
‘Percentage of Incidents resolved by the Service Desk’ 
to evaluate the performance of the Service Desk. 
This worked effectively for about two years, after which
the IT manager began to realize that this KPI was being
used to prevent effective Problem Management, i.e. if,
after two years, 80% of all incidents are easy enough to be
resolved in 10 minutes on the first call, why have we not
come up with a solution for them? In effect, the KPI now
became a measure for how ineffective the Problem
Management teams were.

5.1.2.11 Interfaces to other Service Lifecycle
practices
Operational Monitoring and Continual Service
Improvement
This section has focused on Operational Monitoring and
Reporting, but monitoring also forms the starting point for
Continual Service Improvement. This is covered in the
Continual Service Improvement publication, but key
differences are outlined here.

Quality is the key objective of monitoring for Continual
Service Improvement (CSI). Monitoring will therefore focus
on the effectiveness of a service, process, tool,
organization or CI. The emphasis is not on assuring real-
time service performance; rather it is on identifying where
improvements can be made to the existing level of service,
or IT performance.

Monitoring for CSI will therefore tend to focus on
detecting exceptions and resolutions. For example, CSI is
not as interested in whether an incident was resolved, but
whether it was resolved within the agreed time and
whether future incidents can be prevented.

CSI is not only interested in exceptions, though. If an SLA
is consistently met over time, CSI will also be interested in
determining whether that level of performance can be
sustained at a lower cost or whether it needs to be
upgraded to an even better level of performance. CSI may
therefore also need access to regular performance reports.

However, since CSI is unlikely to need, or be able to cope
with, the vast quantities of data that are produced by all
monitoring activity, they will most likely focus on a
specific subset of monitoring at any given time. This could
be determined by input from the business or
improvements to technology.

92

| Common Service Operation activities

This has two main implications:

■ Monitoring for CSI will change over time. They may be
interested in monitoring the e-mail service one quarter
and then move on to look at HR systems in the next
quarter.

■ This means that Service Operation and CSI need to

build a process which will help them to agree on
what areas need to be monitored and for what
purpose.

5.2 IT OPERATIONS

5.2.1 Console Management/Operations
Bridge
These provide a central coordination point for managing
various classes of events, detecting incidents, managing
routine operational activities and reporting on the status
or performance of technology components.

Observation and monitoring of the IT Infrastructure can
occur from a centralized console – to which all system
events are routed. Historically, this involved the
monitoring of the master operations console of one or
more mainframes – but these days is more likely to
involve monitoring of a server farm(s), storage devices,
network components, applications, databases, or any other
CIs, including any remaining mainframe(s), from a single
location, known as the Operations Bridge.

There are two theories about how the Operations Bridge
was so named. One is that it resembles the bridge of a
large, automated ship (such as spaceships commonly seen
in science fiction movies). The other theory is that the
Operations Bridge represents a link between the IT
Operations teams and the traditional Help Desk. In some
organizations this means that the functions of Operational
Control and the Help Desk were merged into the Service
Desk, which performed both sets of duties in a single
physical location.

Regardless of how it was named, an Operations Bridge will
pull together all of the critical observation points within
the IT Infrastructure so that they can be monitored and
managed from a centralised location with minimal effort.
The devices being monitored are likely to be physically
dispersed and may be located in centralized computer
installations or dispersed within the user community, 
or both.

The Operations Bridge will combine many activities, which
might include Console Management, event handling, first-
line network management, Job Scheduling and out-of-
hours support (covering for the Service Desk and/or

second-line support groups if they do not work 24/7). 
In some organizations, the Service Desk is part of the
Operations Bridge.

The physical location and layout of the Operation’s Bridge
needs to be carefully designed to give the correct
accessibility and visibility of all relevant screens and
devices to authorised personnel. However, this will
become a very sensitive area where controlled access and
tight security will be essential.

Smaller organizations may not have a physical Operations
Bridge, but there will certainly still be the need for Console
Management, usually combined with other technical roles.
For example, a single team of technical staff will manage
the network, servers and applications. Part of their role will
be to monitor the consoles for those systems – often
using virtual consoles so that they can perform the activity
from any location. However, it should be noted that these
virtual consoles are powerful tools and, if used in insecure
locations or over unsecured connections, could represent a
significant security threat.

5.2.2 Job Scheduling
IT Operations will perform standard routines, queries or
reports delegated to it as part of delivering services; or as
part of routine housekeeping delegated by Technical and
Application Management teams.

Job Scheduling involves defining and initiating job-
scheduling software packages to run batch and real-time
work. This will normally involve daily, weekly, monthly,
annual and ad hoc schedules to meet business needs.

In addition to the initial design, or periodic redesign, of
the schedules, there are likely to be frequent amendments
or adjustments to make during which job dependencies
have to be identified and accommodated. There will also
be a role to play in defining alerts and Exception Reports
to be used for monitoring/checking job schedules. Change
Management plays an important role in assessing and
validating major changes to schedules, as well as creating
Standard Change procedures for more routine changes.

Run-time parameters and/or files have to be received (or
expedited if delayed) and input – and all run-time logs
have to be checked and any failures identified.

If failures do occur, then re-runs will have to be initiated,
under the guidance of the appropriate business units,
often with different parameters or amended data/file
versions. This will require careful communications to
ensure correct parameters and files are used.

Many organizations are faced with increasing overnight
batch schedules which can, if they overrun the overnight

Common Service Operation activities  |

93

batch slot, adversely impact upon the online day services
– so are seeking ways of utilizing maximum overnight
capacity and performance, in conjunction with Capacity
Management. This is where Workload Management
techniques can be useful, such as:

■ Re-scheduling of work to avoid contention on specific

devices or at specific times and improve overall
throughput

■ Migration of workloads to alternative

platforms/environments to gain improved performance
and/or throughput (virtualization capabilities make this
far more achievable by allowing dynamic, automated
migration)

■ Careful timing and ‘interleaving’ of jobs to gain

maximum utilization of available resources.

Anecdote

One large organization, which was faced with batch
overrun/utilization problems, identified that, due to
human nature where people were seeking to be
‘tidy’, all jobs were being started on the hour or at
15-minute intervals during the hour (i.e. n o’clock, 15
minutes past, half past, 15 minutes to, etc.).

By re-scheduling of work so that it started as soon as
other work finished, and staggering the start times of
other work, it was able to gain significant reductions
in contention and achieve much quicker overall
processing, which resolved its problems without a
need for upgrades.

Job Scheduling has become a highly sophisticated activity,
including any number of variables – such as time-
sensitivity, critical and non-critical dependencies, workload
balancing, failure and resubmission, etc. As a result, most
operations rely on Job Scheduling tools that allow IT
Operations to schedule jobs for the optimal use of
technology to achieve Service Level Objectives.

The latest generation of scheduling tools allows for a
single toolset to schedule and automate technical
activities and Service Management process activities (such
as Change Scheduling). While this is a good opportunity
for improving efficiency, it also represents a greater single
point of failure. Organizations using this type of tool
therefore still use point solutions as agents and also as a
backup in case the main toolset fails.

5.2.3 Backup and Restore
Backup and Restore is essentially a component of good IT
Service Continuity Planning. As such, Service Design
should ensure that there are solid backup strategies for

each service and Service Transition should ensure that
these are properly tested.

In addition, regulatory requirements specify that certain
types of organization (such as Financial Services or listed
companies) must have a formal Backup and Restore
strategy in place and that this strategy is executed and
audited. The exact requirements will vary from country to
country and by industry sector. This should be determined
during Service Design and built into the service
functionality and documentation.

The only point of taking backups is that they may need to
be restored at some point. For this reason it is not as
important to define how to back a system up as it is to
define what components are at risk and how to effectively
mitigate that risk.

There are any number of tools available for Backup and
Restore, but it is worth noting that features of storage
technologies used for business data are being used for
backup/restore (e.g. snapshots). There is therefore an
increasing degree of integration between Backup and
Restore activities and those of Storage and Archiving (see
section 5.6).

5.2.3.1 Backup
The organization’s data has to be protected and this will
include backup (copying) and storage of data in remote
locations where it can be protected – and used should it
need to be restored due to loss, corruption or
implementation of IT Service Continuity Plans.

An overall backup strategy must be agreed with the
business, covering:

■ What data has to be backed up and the frequency

and intervals to be used.

■ How many generations of data have to be retained –
this may vary by the type of data being backed up, or
what type of file (e.g. data file or application
executable).

■ The type of backup (full, partial, incremental) and

checkpoints to be used.

■ The locations to be used for storage (likely to include

disaster recovery sites) and rotation schedules.

■ Transportation methods (e.g. file transfer via the

network, physical transportation on magnetic media).

■ Testing/checks to be performed, such as test-reads,

test restores, check-sums etc.

■ Recovery Point Objective. This describes the point to

which data will be restored after recovery of an IT
Service. This may involve loss of data. For example, a
Recovery Point Objective of one day may be

94

| Common Service Operation activities

supported by daily backups, and up to 24 hours of
data may be lost. Recovery Point Objectives for each IT
service should be negotiated, agreed and documented
in OLAs, SLAs and UCs.

■ Recovery Time Objective. This describes the

maximum time allowed for recovery of an IT service
following an interruption. The Service Level to be
provided may be less than normal Service Level
Targets. Recovery Time Objectives for each IT service
should be negotiated, agreed and documented in
OLAs, SLAs and UCs.

■ How to verify that the backups will work if they need

to be restored. Even if there are no error codes
generated, there may be several reasons why the
backup cannot be restored. A good backup strategy
and operations procedures will minimize the risk of
this happening. Backup procedures should include a
verification step to ensure that the backups are
complete and that they will work if a restore is
needed. Where any backup failures are detected,
recovery actions must be initiated.

There is also a need to procure and manage the necessary
media (disks, tapes, CDs, etc.) to be used for backups, so
that there is no shortage of supply.

Where automated devices are being used, pre-loading of
the required media will be needed in advance. When
loading and clearing media returned from off-site storage
it is important that there is a procedure for verifying that
these are the right ones. This will prevent the most recent
backup being overwritten with faulty data, and then
having no valid data to restore. After successful backups
have been taken, the media must be removed for storage.

The actual initiation of the backups might be automated,
or carried out from the Operations Bridge.

Some organizations may utilize Operations staff to perform
the physical transportation and racking of backup copies
to/from remote locations, where in other cases this may
be handed over to other groups such as internal security
staff or external contractors.

If backups are being automated or performed remotely,
then Event Monitoring capabilities should be considered
so that any failures can be detected early and rectified
before they cause problems. In such cases IT Operations
has a role to play in defining alerts and escalation paths.

In all cases, IT Operations staff must be trained in backup
(and restore) procedures – which must be well
documented in the organization’s IT Operations
Procedures Manual. Any specific requirements or targets
should be referenced in OLAs or UCs where appropriate,

while any user or customer requirements or activity should
be specified in the appropriate SLA.

5.2.3.2 Restore
A restore can be initiated from a number of sources,
ranging from an event that indicates data corruption,
through to a Service Request from a user or customer
logged at the Service Desk. A restore may be needed in
the case of:

■ Corrupt data
■ Lost data
■ Disaster recovery/IT Service Continuity situation
■ Historical data required for forensic investigation.

The steps to be taken will include:

■ Location of the appropriate data/media
■ Transportation or transfer back to the physical recovery

location

■ Agreement on the checkpoint recovery point and the
specific location for the recovered data (disk, directory,
folder etc)

■ Actual restoration of the file/data (copy-back and any
roll-back/roll-forward needed to arrive at the agreed
checkpoint

■ Checking to ensure successful completion of the

restore – with further recovery action if needed until
success has been achieved.

■ User/customer sign-off.

5.2.4 Print and Output
Many services consist of generating and delivering
information in printed or electronic form. Ensuring the
right information gets to the right people, with full
integrity, requires formal control and management.

Print (physical) and Output (electronic) facilities and
services need to be formally managed because:

■ They often represent the tangible output of a service.

The ability to measure that this output has reached
the appropriate destination is therefore very important
(e.g. checking whether files with financial transaction
data have actually reached a bank through an FTP
service)

■ Physical and electronic output often contains sensitive

or confidential information. It is vital that the
appropriate levels of security are applied to both the
generation and the delivery of this output.

Many organizations will have centralised bulk printing
requirements which IT Operations must handle.

Common Service Operation activities  |

95

In addition to the physical loading and re-loading of paper
and the operation and care of the printers, other activities
may be needed, such as:

■ Interfacing to hardware (H/W) support; arranging

maintenance, agreeing slots, identifying H/W failure,
liaison with H/W engineering.

■ Agreement and setting of pre-notification of large

print runs and alerts to prevent excessive printing by
rogue print jobs

■ Physical control of high-value stationery such as

company cheques or certificates, etc.

■ Management of the physical and electronic storage

required to generate the output. In many cases IT will
be expected to provide archives for the printed and
electronic materials

■ Control of all printed material so as to adhere to data
protection legislation and regulation e.g. HIPAA (Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) in the
USA, or FSA (Financial Services Authority) in the UK.

Where print and output services are delivered directly to
the users, it is important that the responsibility for
maintaining the printers or storage devices is clearly
defined. For example, most users assume that cleaning
and maintenance of printers must be performed by IT. If
this is not the case, this must be clearly stated in the SLA.

5.3 MAINFRAME MANAGEMENT

Mainframes are still widely in use and have well
established and mature practices. Mainframes form the
central component of many services and its performance
will therefore set a baseline for service performance and
user or customer expectations, although they may never
know that they are using the mainframe.

The ways in which mainframe management teams are
organized are quite diverse. In some organizations
Mainframe Management is a single, highly specialized
team that manages all aspects from daily operations
through to system engineering. In other organizations, the
activities are performed by several teams or departments,
with engineering and third-level support being provided
by one team and daily operations being combined with
the rest of IT Operations (and very probably managed
through the Operations Bridge).

Typically, the following activities are likely to be
undertaken:

■ Mainframe operating system maintenance and support
■ Third-level support for any mainframe-related

incidents/problems
■ Writing job scripts
■ System programming

■ Provision of information and assistance to Capacity
Management to help achieve optimum throughput,
utilization and performance from the mainframe.

5.4 SERVER MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT

Servers are used in most organizations to provide flexible
and accessible services from hosting applications or
databases, running client/server services, Storage, Print and
File Management. Successful management of servers is
therefore essential for successful Service Operation.

The procedures and activities which must be undertaken
by the Server Team(s) or department(s) – separate teams
may be needed where different server-types are used
(UNIX, Wintel etc) – include:

■ Operating system support: Support and

maintenance of the appropriate operating system(s)
and related utility software (e.g. failover software)
including patch management and involvement in
defining backup and restore policies.

■ Licence management for all server CIs, especially

operating systems, utilities and any application
software not managed by the Application
Management teams.

■ Third-level support: Third-level support for all server

and/or server operating system-related incidents,
including diagnosis and restoration activities. This will
also include liaison with third-party hardware support
contractors and/or manufacturers as needed to
escalate hardware-related incidents.

■ Procurement advice: Advice and guidance to the
business on the selection, sizing, procurement and
usage of servers and related utility software to meet
business needs.

■ System security: Control and maintenance of the
access controls and permissions within the relevant
server environment(s) as well as appropriate system
and physical security measures. These include
identification and application of security patches,
Access Management (see section 4.5) and intrusion
detection.

■ Definition and management of virtual servers. This

implies that any server that has been designed and
built around a common standard can be used to
process workloads from a range of applications or
users. Server Management will be required to set these
standards and then ensure that workloads are

96

| Common Service Operation activities

appropriately balanced and distributed. They are also
responsible for being able to track which workload is
being processed by which server so that they are able
to deal with incidents effectively.

■ Capacity and Performance: Provide information and

assistance to Capacity Management to help achieve
optimum throughput, utilization and performance
from the available servers. This is discussed in more
detail in Service Design, but includes providing
guidance on, and installation and operation of,
virtualization software so as to achieve value for
money by obtaining the highest levels of performance
and utilization from the minimal number of servers.

■ Other routine activities include:

upgrades to the physical network infrastructure. This is
done through Service Design and Service Transition.
■ Third-level support for all network related activities,

including investigation of network issues (e.g. pinging
or trace route and/or use of network management
software tools – although it should be noted that
pinging a server does not necessarily mean that the
service is available!) and liaison with third-parties as
necessary. This also includes the installation and use of
‘sniffer’ tools, which analyse network traffic, to assist in
incident and problem resolution.

■ Maintenance and support of network operating system

and middleware software including patch
management, upgrades, etc.

● Defining standard builds for servers as part of the

spot potential performance or bottleneck issues.

■ Reconfiguring or rerouting of traffic to achieve

● Building and installing new servers as part of
ongoing maintenance or for the provision of 
new services. This is discussed in more detail in
Service Transition

● Setting up and managing clusters, which are aimed

at building redundancy, improving service
performance and making the infrastructure easier
to manage.

■ Ongoing maintenance. This typically consists of

replacing servers or ‘blades’ on a rolling schedule to
ensure that equipment is replaced before it fails or
becomes obsolete. This results in servers that are not
only fully functional, but also capable of supporting
evolving services.

■ Decommissioning and disposal of old server

equipment. This is often done in conjunction with the
organization’s environmental policies for disposal.

5.5 NETWORK MANAGEMENT

As most IT services are dependent on connectivity,
Network Management will be essential to deliver services
and also to enable Service Operation staff to access and
manage key service components.

Network Management will have overall responsibility for
all of the organization’s own Local Area Networks (LANs),
Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) and Wide Area
Networks (WANs) – and will also be responsible for liaising
with third-party network suppliers.

Their role will include the following activities:

■ Initial planning and installation of new

networks/network components; maintenance and

improved throughput or batter balance – definition of
rules for dynamic balancing/routing.

■ Network security (in liaison with the organization’s

Information Security Management) including firewall
management, access rights, password protection etc.
■ Assigning and managing IP addresses, Domain Name
Systems (DNSs – which convert the name of a service
to its associated IP address) and Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) systems, which enable
access and use of the DNS.

■ Managing Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
■ Implementing, monitoring and maintaining Intrusion
Detection Systems on behalf of Information Security
Management. They will also be responsible for
ensuring that there is no denial of service to
legitimate users of the network.

■ Updating Configuration Management as necessary by

documenting CIs, status, relationships, etc.

Network Management is also often responsible, often in
conjunction with Desktop Support, for remote connectivity
issues such as dial-in, dial-back and VPN facilities provided
to home-workers, remote workers or suppliers.

Some Network Management teams or departments will
also have responsibility for voice/telephony, including the
provision and support for exchanges, lines, ACD, statistical
software packages etc. and for Voice over Internet Protocol
(VoIP) and Remote Monitoring (RMon) systems.

At the same time, many organizations see VoIP and
telephony as specialized areas and have teams dedicated
to managing this technology. Their activities will be 
similar to those described above.

Common Service Operation activities  |

97

Note on managing VoIP as a service

Many organizations have experienced performance
and availability problems with their VoIP solutions, in
spite of the fact that there seems to be more than
adequate bandwidth available. This results in dropped
calls and poor sound quality. This is usually because
of variations in bandwidth utilization during the call,
which is often the result of utilization of the network
by other users, applications or other web activity. This
has led to the differentiation between measuring the
bandwidth available to initiate a call (Service Access
Bandwidth – or SAB) and the amount of bandwidth
that must be continuously available during the call
(Service Utilization Bandwidth – or SUB). Care should
be taken in differentiating between these when
designing, managing or measuring VoIP services.

5.6 STORAGE AND ARCHIVE

Many services require the storage of data for a specific
time and also for that data to be available off-line for a
certain period after it is no longer used. This is often due
to regulatory or legislative requirements, but also because
history and audit data are invaluable for a variety of
purposes, including marketing, product development,
forensic investigations, etc.

A separate team or department may be needed to
manage the organization’s data storage technology 
such as:

and who may access it. Specific responsibilities will
include:

■ Definition of data storage policies and procedures
■ File storage naming conventions, hierarchy and

placement decisions

■ Design, sizing, selection, procurement, configuration

and operation of all data storage infrastructure

■ Maintenance and support for all utility and

middleware data-storage software

■ Liaison with Information Lifecycle Management

team(s) or Governance teams to ensure compliance
with freedom of information, data protection and IT
governance regulations

■ Involvement with definition and agreement of

archiving policy

■ Housekeeping of all data storage facilities
■ Archiving data according to rules and schedules

defined during Service Design. The Storage teams or
departments will also provide input into the definition
of these rules and will provide reports on their
effectiveness as input into future design

■ Retrieval of archived data as needed (e.g. for audit

purposes, for forensic evidence, or to meet any other
business requirements)

■ Third-line support for storage- and archive-related

incidents.

5.7 DATABASE ADMINISTRATION

■ Storage devices, such as disks, controllers, tapes, etc.
■ Network Attached Storage (NAS), which is storage

attached to a network and accessible by several clients

■ Storage Area Networks (SANs) designed to attach

computer storage devices such as disk array controllers
and tape libraries. In addition to storage devices, a
SAN will also require the management of several
network components, such as hubs, cables, etc.

Database Administration must work closely with key
Application Management teams or departments – and in
some organizations the functions may be combined or
linked under a single management structure.
Organizational options include:

■ Database administration being performed by each

Application Management team for all the applications
under its control

■ Direct Attached Storage (DAS), which is a storage

■ A dedicated department, which manages all databases,

device directly attached to a server

regardless of type or application

■ Content Addressable Storage (CAS) which is storage
that is based on retrieving information based on its
content rather than location. The focus in this type of
system is on understanding the nature of the data and
information stored, rather than on providing specific
storage locations.

Regardless of what type of storage systems are being
used, Storage and Archiving will require the management
of the infrastructure components as well as the policies
related to where data is stored, for how long, in what form

■ Several departments, each managing one type of
database, regardless of what application they are 
part of.

Database Administration works to ensure the optimal
performance, security and functionality of databases that
they manage. Database Administrators typically have the
following responsibilities:

■ Creation and maintenance of database standards 

and policies

■ Initial database design, creation, testing

98

| Common Service Operation activities

■ Management of the database availability and

performance; resilience, sizing, capacity 
volumetrics etc.

■ Resilience may require database replication, which

would be the responsibility of Database Administration

■ Ongoing administration of database objects: indexes,

tables, views, constraints, sequences snapshots and
stored procedures; page locks – to achieve 
optimum utilization

■ The definition of triggers that will generate events,

which in turn will alert database administrators 
of potential performance or integrity issues with 
the database

■ Performing database housekeeping – the routine tasks

that ensure that the databases are functioning
optimally and securely, e.g. tuning, indexing, etc.

generally kept up to date, it is also a good source of data
and verification for the CMS.

Directory Services Management refers to the process that
is used to manage Directory Services. Its activities include:

■ Working as part of Service Design and Service

Transition to ensure that new services are accessible
and controlled when they are deployed

■ Locating resources on a network (if these have not

already been defined during Service Design)

■ Tracking the status of those resources and providing

the ability to manage those resources remotely

■ Managing the rights of specific users or groups of

users to access resources on a network

■ Defining and maintaining naming conventions to be

used for resources on a network

■ Monitoring of usage; transaction volumes, response

■ Ensuring consistency of naming and access control on

times, concurrency levels, etc.

■ Generating reports. These could be reports based on

the data in the database, or reports related to the
performance and integrity of the database

■ Identification, reporting and management of database

security issues; audit trails and forensics

■ Assistance in designing database backup, archiving

and storage strategy

■ Assistance in designing database alerts and event

management

■ Provision of third-level support for all database-related

incidents.

5.8 DIRECTORY SERVICES MANAGEMENT

A Directory Service is a specialized software application
that manages information about the resources available
on a network and which users have access to. It is the
basis for providing access to those resources and for
ensuring that unauthorized access is detected and
prevented (see section 4.5 for detailed information on
Access Management).

Directory Services views each resource as an object of the
Directory Server and assigns it a name. Each name is
linked to the resource’s network address, so that users
don’t have to memorize confusing and complex addresses.

Directory Services is based on the OSI’s X.500 standards
and commonly uses protocols such as Directory Access
Protocol (DAP) or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP). LDAP is used to support user credentials for
application login and often includes internal and external
user/customer data which is especially good for extranet
call logging. Since LDAP is a critical operational tool, and

different networks in the organization

■ Linking different Directory Services throughout the
organization to form a distributed Directory Service,
i.e. users will only see one logical set of network
resources. This is called Distribution of Directory
Services

■ Monitoring Events on the Directory Services, such as

unsuccessful attempts to access a resource, and taking
the appropriate action where required

■ Maintaining and updating the tools used to manage

Directory Services.

5.9 DESKTOP SUPPORT

As most users access IT services using desktop or laptop
computers, it is key that these are supported to ensure the
agreed levels of availability and performance of services.

Desktop Support will have overall responsibility for all of
the organization’s desktop and laptop computer hardware,
software and peripherals. Specific responsibilities will
include:

■ Desktop policies and procedures, for example licensing

policies, use of laptops or desktops for personal
purposes, USB lockdown, etc.

■ Designing and agreeing standard desktop images
■ Desktop service maintenance including deployment of

releases, upgrades, patches and hot-fixes (in
conjunction with Release Management (see Service
Transition publication for further details)
■ Design and implementation of desktop

archiving/rebuild policy (including policy relating to
cookies, favourites, templates, personal data, etc.)

Common Service Operation activities  |

99

■ Third-level support of desktop-related incidents,

including desk-side visits where necessary

■ Support for connectivity issues (in conjunction with

Network Management) to home-workers, mobile 
staff, etc.

■ Configuration control and audit of all desktop
equipment (in conjunction with Configuration
Management and IT Audit).

Middleware Management is the set of activities that are
used to manage middleware. These include:

■ Working as part of Service Design and Transition to

ensure that the appropriate middleware solutions are
chosen and that they can perform optimally when
they are deployed

■ Ensuring the correct operation of middleware through

monitoring and control

■ Detecting and resolving Incidents related to

5.10 MIDDLEWARE MANAGEMENT

middleware

Middleware is software that connects or integrates
software components across distributed or disparate
applications and systems. Middleware enables the effective
transfer of data between applications, and is therefore key
to services that are dependent on multiple applications or
data sources.

A variety of technologies are currently used to support
program-to-program communication, such as object
request brokers, message-oriented middleware, remote
procedure calls and point-to-point web services. Newer
technologies are emerging all the time, for example
Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), which enables programs,
systems and services to communicate with each other
regardless of the architecture and origin of the
applications. This is especially being used in the context of
deploying Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs).

Middleware Management can be performed as part of an
Application Management function (where it is dedicated
to a specific application) or as part of a Technical
Management function (where it is viewed as an extension
to the Operating System of a specific platform).

Functionality provided by middleware includes:

■ Providing transfer mechanisms for data from various

applications or data sources

■ Maintaining and updating middleware, including

licensing, and installing new versions

■ Defining and maintaining information about how
applications are linked through Middleware. This
should be part of the CMS (see Service Transition
publication).

5.11 INTERNET/WEB MANAGEMENT

Many organizations conduct much of their business
through the Internet and are therefore heavily dependent
upon the availability and performance of their websites. In
such cases a separate Internet/Web Support team or
department will be desirable and justified.

The responsibilities of such a team or department
incorporate both Intranet and Internet and are likely to
include:

■ Defining architectures for Internet and web services
■ The specification of standards for development and

management of web-based applications, content,
websites and web pages. This will typically be done
during Service Design

■ Design, testing, implementation and maintenance of

websites. This will include the architecture of websites
and the mapping of content to be made available

■ Sending work to another application or procedure for

■ In many organizations, web management will include

processing

the editing of content to be posted onto the web

■ Transmitting data or information to other systems,

■ Maintenance of all web development and

such as sourcing data for publication on websites (e.g.
publishing Incident status information)

■ Releasing updated software modules across distributed

environments

■ Collation and distribution of system messages and

instructions, for example Events or operational scripts
that need to be run on remote devices

■ Multicast setup with networks. Multicast is the delivery

of information to a group of destinations
simultaneously using the most efficient delivery route

■ Managing queue sizes.

management applications

■ Liaison and advice to web-content teams within the

business. Content may reside in applications or
storage devices, which implies close liaison with
Application Management and other Technical
Management teams

■ Liaison with and supplier management of ISPs, hosts,
third-party monitoring or virtualization organizations
etc. In many organizations the ISPs are managed as
part of Network Management

■ Third-level support for Internet-/web-related incidents

100 | Common Service Operation activities

■ Support for interfaces with back-end and legacy

systems. This will often mean working with members
of the Application Development and Management
teams to ensure secure access and consistency

fire suppression, water, heating and cooling 
systems, etc.

■ Safety is concerned with compliance to all legislation,

standards and policies relative to the safety of

■ Physical Access Control refers to ensuring that 

and including: heartbeat testing, user experience
simulation, benchmarking, on-demand load balancing,

■ Website availability, resilience and security. This will

form part of the overall Information Security
Management of the organization.

5.12 FACILITIES AND DATA CENTRE
MANAGEMENT

Facilities Management refers to the management of the
physical environment of IT Operations, usually located in
Data Centres or computer rooms. This is a vast and
complex area and this publication will provide an
overview of its key role and activities. A more detailed
overview is contained in Appendix E.

In many respects Facilities Management could be viewed
as a function in its own right. However, because this 
publication is focused on where IT Operations are housed, 
it will cover Facilities Management specifically as it relates
to the management of Data Centres and as a subset of the
IT Operations Management function.

The main components of Facilities Management are 
as follows:

■ Building Management, which refers to the

maintenance and upkeep of the buildings that house
the IT staff and Data Centre. Typical activities include
cleaning, waste disposal, parking management and
access control

■ Equipment Hosting, which ensures that all special

requirements are provided for the physical housing of
equipment and the teams that support them

■ Power Management, which refers to managing the

sourcing and utilization of power sources that are
used to keep the facility functional. This definition of
Power Management has a number of implications,
which are discussed in Appendix E. Note that
information about power utilization is important for
planning the capacity of both new services and new
buildings

■ Environmental Conditioning and Alert Systems,

which include the specification, maintenance and
monitoring of systems such as smoke detection and

the facility is only accessed by authorized personnel
and that any unauthorized access is detected 
and managed. This is discussed in more detail in
Appendix F

■ Shipping and Receiving refers to the management of
all equipment, furniture, mail, etc. that leaves or enters
the building. It ensures that only appropriate items are
entering or leaving the building and that they are
routed to the correct party

■ Involvement in Contract Management of the various
suppliers and service providers involved in the facility
■ Maintenance refers to regular, scheduled upkeep of
the facility, as well as the detection and resolution of
problems with the facility.

Important note regarding Data Centres

Data Centres are generally specialized facilities and,
while they use and benefit from generic Facilities
Management disciplines, they need to adapt these.
For example layout, heating and conditioning, power
planning and many other aspects are all managed
uniquely in Data Centres.

This means that, although Data Centres may be
facilities owned by an organization, they are better
managed under the authority of IT Operations,
although there may be a functional reporting line
between IT and the department that manages other
facilities for the organization.

5.12.1 Data Centre strategies
Managing a Data Centre is far more than hosting an open
space where technical groups install and manage
equipment, using their own approaches and procedures. It
requires an integrated set of processes and procedures
involving all IT groups at every stage of the ITSM Lifecycle.
Data Centre operations are governed by strategic and
design decisions for management and control and are
executed by operators. This requires a number of key
factors to be put in place:

■ Data Centre Automation. Specialized automation
systems that reduce the need for manual operators
and which monitor and track the status of the facility
and all IT operations at all times

■ Policy-based management, where the rules of

automation and resource allocation are managed by
policy, rather than having to go through complex
change procedures every time processing is moved
from one resource to another

■ Real time services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
■ Standardization of equipment. This provides greater

ease of management, more consistent levels of
performance and a means of providing multiple
services across similar technology. Standardization also
reduces the variety of technical expertise required to
manage equipment in the Data Centre and to provide
services

■ SOAs, where service components can be reused,

interchanged and replaced very quickly and with no
impact on the business. This will make it possible for
the Data Centre to be highly responsive in meeting
changing business demands without having to go
through lengthy and involved re-engineering and re-
architecting

■ Virtualization. This means that IT Services are

delivered using an ever-changing set of equipment,
geared to meet current demand. For example, an
application may run on a dedicated device together
with its database during high-demand times, but
shifted to a shared device with its database on a
remote device during non-peak times – all automated
and automatic. This will mean even greater savings of
costs as any equipment can be used at any time,
without any human intervention, except to perform
maintenance and replace failed equipment. The IT
Infrastructure is more resilient since any component is
backed up by any number of similar components, any
of which could take over a failed component’s
workload automatically.
Remote monitoring, control and management
equipment and systems will be essential to manage a
virtualized environment, as many services will not be
linked to any one specific piece of equipment.

■ Unified management systems have become more

important as services run across multiple locations and
technologies. Today it is important to define what
actions need to be taken and what systems will
perform that action. This means investing in solutions
that will allow Infrastructure managers to simply
specify what outcome is required, and allowing the
management system to calculate the best combination
of tools and actions to achieve the outcome.

5.13 INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT
AND SERVICE OPERATION

Information Security Management as a process is covered
in the ITIL Service Design publication. Information Security
Management has overall responsibility for setting policies,
standards and procedures to ensure the protection of the
organization’s assets, data, information and IT services.
Service Operation teams play a role in executing these
policies, standards and procedures and will work closely
with the teams or departments responsible for Information
Security Management.

Service Operation teams cannot take ownership of
Information Security Management, as this would represent
a conflict. There needs to be segregation of roles between
the groups defining and managing the process and the
groups executing specific activities as part of ongoing
operation. This will help protect against breaches to
security measures, as no single individual should have
control over two or more phases of a transaction or
operation. Information Security Management should assign
responsibilities to ensure a cross-check of duties.

The role of Service Operation teams is outlined next.

5.13.1 Policing and reporting
This will involve Operation staff performing specific
policing activities such as the checking of system journals,
logs, event/monitoring alerts etc, intrusion detection
and/or reporting of actual or potential security breaches.
This is done in conjunction with Information Security
Management to provide a check and balance system 
to ensure effective detection and management of 
security issues.

Service Operation staff are often first to detect security
events and are in the best position to be able to shut
down and/or remove access to compromised systems.

Particular attention will be needed in the case of third-
party organizations that require physical access into the
organization. Service Operation staff may be required 
to escort visitors into sensitive areas and/or control 
their access.

They may also have a role to play in controlling network
access to third parties, such as hardware maintainers
dialling in for diagnostic purposes, etc.

5.13.2 Technical assistance
Some technical support may need to be provided to 
IT Security staff to assist in investigating security 
incidents and assist in production of reports or in

102 | Common Service Operation activities

gathering forensic evidence for use in disciplinary 
action or criminal prosecutions.

Technical advice and assistance may also be needed
regarding potential security improvements (e.g. setting up
appropriate firewalls or access/password controls).

The use of event, incident, problem and configuration
management information can be relied on to provide
accurate chronologies of security-related investigations.

5.13.3 Operational security control
For operational reasons, technical staff will often need to
have privileged access to key technical areas (e.g. root
system passwords, physical access to Data Centres or
communications rooms etc). It is therefore essential that
adequate controls and audit trails are kept of all such
privileged activities so as to deter and detect any 
security events.

Physical controls need to be in place for all secure areas
with logging in-out of all staff. Where third-party staff or
visitors need access, it may be Service Operation staff that
are responsible for escorting and managing the movement
of such personnel.

In the case of privileged systems access, this needs to be
restricted to only those people whose need to access the
system has been verified – and withdrawn immediately
when that need no longer exists. An audit trail must be
maintained of who has had access and when, and of all
activities performed using those access levels.

5.13.4 Screening and vetting
All Service Operation staff should be screened and 
vetted to a security level appropriate to the organization
in question.

Suppliers and third-party contractors should also be
screened and vetted – both the organizations and the
specific personnel involved. Many organizations have
started using police or government agency background
checks, especially where contractors will be working with
classified systems. Where necessary, appropriate non-
disclosure and confidentiality agreements must be agreed.

5.13.5 Training and awareness
All Service Operation staff should be given regular and
ongoing training and awareness of the organization’s
security policy and procedures. This should include details
of disciplinary measures in place. In addition, any security
requirements should be specified in the employee’s
contract of employment.

5.13.6 Documented policies and procedures
Service Operation documented procedures must include
all relevant information relating to security issues –
extracted from the organization’s overall security policy
documents. Consideration should be given to the use of
handbooks to assist in getting the security messages out
to all relevant staff.

5.14 IMPROVEMENT OF OPERATIONAL
ACTIVITIES

All Service Operation staff should be constantly looking for
areas in which process improvements can be made to give
higher IT service quality and/or performed in a more cost-
effective way. This might include some of the following
activities.

5.14.1 Automation of manual tasks
Any tasks which have to be carried out manually,
particularly those that have to be regularly repeated, are
likely to be more time consuming, costly and error prone
than those that can be systemised and automated. All
tasks should be examined for potential automation to
reduce effort and costs and to minimize potential errors.

A judgement must be made on the costs of the
automation and the likely benefits that will occur.

5.14.2 Reviewing makeshift activities or
procedures
Because of the pragmatic nature of Service Operation, it
may sometimes arise that makeshift activities or processes
are introduced to address short-term operational
expediencies. There is a danger that such practices can be
continued and become the ‘norm’ – leading to ongoing
inefficiencies. Where any makeshift activities or procedures
do have to be introduced it is important that these are
reviewed as soon as the immediate expediency is
overcome – and either dispensed with or replaced with
efficient agreed processes for the longer term.

5.14.3 Operational Audits
Regular audits should be conducted of all Service
Operation processes to ensure that they are working
satisfactorily.

5.14.4 Using Incident and Problem
Management
Problem and Incident Management provide a rich source
of operational improvement opportunities. These

Common Service Operation activities  | 103

processes are discussed in detail in Chapter 4 of this
publication.

5.14.5 Communication
It should go without saying that good communication
about changing requirements, technology and processes
will result in improvement in Service Operation. However,
communication is often neglected. Service Operation
improvement is dependent on formal and regular
communication between teams responsible for design,
support and operation of services.

5.14.6 Education and training
Service Operation teams should understand the
importance of what they do on a daily basis. Education is
required to ensure that staff understand what business
functions or services are supported by their activities. This
will encourage greater care and attention to detail and will
also help Service Operation teams to better identify
business priorities.

Training programmes should ensure that all staff have the
appropriate skills for the technology or applications that
they are managing. Training should always be provided
when new technology is introduced, or when existing
technology is changed.

6 Organizing for Service Operation

6.1 FUNCTIONS

A function is a logical concept that refers to the people
and automated measures that execute a defined process,
an activity or a combination of processes or activities. In
larger organizations a function may be broken up and
performed by several departments, teams and groups, or it
may be embodied within a single organizational unit.

The Service Operation functions given in Figure 6.1 are
needed to manage the ‘steady state’ operational IT

environment. These are logical functions and do not
necessarily have to be performed by an equivalent
organizational structure. This means that Technical and
Application Management can be organized in any
combination and into any number of departments. The
second-level groupings in Figure 6.1 are examples of
typical groups of activities performed by Technical
Management (see Chapter 5) and are not a suggested
organization structure.

108 | Organizing for Service Operation

The following is an overview of the Service Operation
functions in Figure 6.1:

■ The Service Desk is the primary point of contact for

users when there is a service disruption, for service
requests or even for some categories of Request for
Change. The Service Desk provides a point of
communication to the users and a point of
coordination for several IT groups and processes. To
enable them to perform these actions effectively the
Service Desk is usually separate from the other Service
Operation functions. In some cases, e.g. where
detailed technical support is offered to users on the
first call, it may be necessary for Technical or
Application Management staff to be on the Service
Desk. This does not mean that the Service Desk
becomes part of the Technical Management function.
In fact, while they are on the Service Desk, they cease
to be a part of the Technical Management or
Application Management functions and become part
of the Service Desk, even if only temporarily.

■ Technical Management provides detailed technical
skills and resources needed to support the ongoing
operation of the IT Infrastructure. Technical
Management also plays an important role in the
design, testing, release and improvement of IT
services. In small organizations, it is possible to
manage this expertise in a single department, but
larger organizations are typically split into a number of
technically specialized departments (see later in this
chapter). In many organizations, the Technical
Management departments are also responsible for the
daily operation of a subset of the IT Infrastructure.
Figure 6.1 shows that, although they are part of a
Technical Management department, staff who perform
these activities are logically part of the IT Operations
Management function.

■ IT Operations Management is the function

responsible for the daily operational activities needed
to manage the IT Infrastructure. This is done according
to the Performance Standards defined during Service
Design. In some organizations this is a single,
centralized department, while in others some activities
and staff are centralized and some are provided by
distributed or specialized departments. This is
illustrated in Figure 6.1 by the overlapping from the
Technical and Application Management functions. IT
Operations Management has two functions that are
unique and which are generally formal organizational
structures. These are:
● IT Operations Control, which is generally staffed

by shifts of operators and which ensures that

routine operational tasks are carried out. IT
Operations Control will also provide centralized
monitoring and control activities, usually using an
Operations Bridge or Network Operations Centre.

● Facilities Management refers to the management

of the physical IT environment, usually Data
Centres or computer rooms. In many organizations
Technical and Application Management are co-
located with IT Operations in large Data Centres. In
some organizations many physical components of
the IT Infrastructure have been outsourced and
Facilities Management may include the
management of the outsourcing contracts.
■ Application Management is responsible for

managing applications throughout their lifecycle. The
Application Management function supports and
maintains operational applications and also plays an
important role in the design, testing and improvement
of applications that form part of IT services.
Application Management is usually divided into
departments based on the application portfolio of the
organization (see the examples in Figure 6.1), thus
allowing easier specialization and more focused
support. In many organizations Application
Management departments have staff who perform
daily operations for those applications. As with
Technical Management, these staff logically form part
of the IT Operations Management function.

Special note on Information Security
Management

Although most would agree that Information Security
Management is a function, it is highly specialized and
spans several phases of the lifecycle. It is also
responsible for the oversight of many activities within
all Service Operation functions. For a more in-depth
description of Information Security Management,
please refer to the Service Design publication and to
section 5.13 of this publication.

6.1.1 Functions and activities
Chapter 5 of this publication introduced a number of
common Service Operation activities. Due to the technical
nature and specialization of these activities, the teams,
groups or departments that perform them are often given
names that correspond to the particular activities. For
example, Network Management could be performed by a
‘Network Management Department’. This, however, is by
no means a rule. There are a number of options available
in mapping activities to a team or department, for
example:

■ One activity could be performed by several teams or

departments, e.g. if an organization has five major
Application Support departments, each supporting 
a different set of applications, each of these
departments could perform Database Administration
for ‘its’ applications

■ One department could perform several activities, e.g.

the Network Management Department could be
responsible for managing the network, Directory
Services Management and Server Management
■ An activity could be performed by groups, e.g.

Security Administration can be performed by any
person with responsibility for managing an application,
server, middleware or desktop.

These organizational decisions are influenced by a number
of factors, such as:

■ The size and location of the organization. Smaller, less

distributed organizations will tend to combine these
functions, whereas large, decentralized organizations
may have several teams or departments performing
the same activity (e.g. per region).

■ The complexity of technology used in the

organization. The higher the number of different
technologies used, the more likely there are to be
several different teams, each doing something similar,
but in a different context (e.g. UNIX Server
Management and Windows Server Management).
■ The availability of skills. Where technical skills are

scarce, it is common for organizations to use
generalists to perform multiple groups of activities –
although, in some cases, security considerations make
this very difficult. For example, an organization
working on classified or secret projects may have to
hire expensive, specialized resources even when that
means relocating them or contracting through
security-cleared vendors.

■ The culture of the organization. Some organizations

prefer to work in highly specialized environments,
while others tend to prefer the flexibility of 
generalist staff.

■ The financial situation of the organization will

determine how many people, with what type of skill,
can be employed and how they will be organized.

As a result of these factors, it is impossible for this
publication to prescribe an appropriate organizational
structure that will fit every situation, however, the
following sections list the required activities under the
functional groups most likely to be involved in their
operation. Please note that this does not mean that all
organizations have to use these divisions. Smaller

Organizing for Service Operation  | 109

organizations will tend to combine these activities into
single departments, or even individuals – if they are even
needed at all.

Special note on outsourcing

These organizational considerations are likely to be
most relevant to internal IT organizations. The
situation becomes even more complex when some or
all of a particular activity or function are outsourced.
Prime opportunities for outsourcing have been the
Service Desk and Network Operations. This will be
covered in more detail in ITIL Complementary
Guidance, but some of the key points to remember
are:

■ Regardless of who is performing the activity, the

company contracting the outsourcer is still
responsible for ensuring that it is performed to a
standard that will support the delivery of services
to their customers and users.

■ Outsourcing to solve an organization’s problems
or as an alternative to good Service Management
processes rarely works. The best results are
obtained if these are in place before outsourcing.

■ Outsourcing works best when there is active

involvement by both organizations. If the staff and
managers of the customer organization
disengage, the outsourcer is unlikely to be
successful, simply because nobody understands
the organization better than the people who work
there.

■ The outsourcer should not determine their

outputs or how they are measured. These are
determined by understanding the business
requirements of users and customers and ensuring
that they can be met by the outsourcer’s
capabilities.

■ Although the outsourcer’s services become an
integral part of the organization, they are still a
third-party organization, with a different set of
business objectives, policies and practices. Security
standards must be upheld and both parties must
clearly understand their respective roles and
contributions.

6.2 SERVICE DESK

A Service Desk is a functional unit made up of a dedicated
number of staff responsible for dealing with a variety of
service events, often made via telephone calls, web
interface, or automatically reported infrastructure events.

110 | Organizing for Service Operation

The Service Desk is a vitally important part of an
organization’s IT Department and should be the single
point of contact for IT users on a day-by-day basis – and
will handle all incidents and service requests, usually 
using specialist software tools to log and manage all 
such events.

The value of an effective Service Desk should not be
underrated – a good Service Desk can often compensate
for deficiencies elsewhere in the IT organization, but a
poor Service Desk (or the lack of a Service Desk) can give
a poor impression of an otherwise very effective IT
organization!

It is therefore very important that the correct calibre of
staff is used on the Service Desk and that IT Managers do
their best to make the desk an attractive place to work to
improve staff retention.

The exact nature, type, size and location of a Service Desk
will vary, depending upon the type of business, number of
users, geography, complexity of calls, scope of services
and many other factors.

In alignment to customer and business requirements, the
IT organization’s senior managers should decide the exact
nature of its required Service Desk (and whether it should
be internal or outsourced to a third party) as part of its
overall ITSM strategy (see Service Strategy publication) –
and then subsequent planning must be done to prepare
for and then implement the appropriate Service Desk
function (either when implementing a new function, or
more likely these days when making necessary
amendments to an existing function – see Service Design
and Service Transition publications).

6.2.1 Justification and role of the Service
Desk
Very little justification is needed today for a Service Desk,
as many organizations have become convinced that this is
by far the best approach for dealing with first-line IT
support issues. One only needs ask the question ‘What is
the alternative?’ to make a compelling case for the Service
Desk concept. Where further justification is needed, the
following benefits should be considered:

■ Improved customer service, perception and satisfaction
■ Increased accessibility through a single point of

contact, communication and information

■ Better-quality and faster turnaround of customer or

user requests

■ Improved teamwork and communication
■ Enhanced focus and a proactive approach to service

provision

■ A reduced negative business impact
■ Better-managed infrastructure and control
■ Improved usage of IT Support resources and increased

productivity of business personnel

■ More meaningful management information for

decision support

■ It is common practice that the Service Desk provides
‘entry-level’ positions for ITSM staff. Working on the
Service Desk is an excellent ‘grounding’ for anyone
who wishes to pursue a career in Service
Management. However, this could also present
challenges with people who do not understand the
business or technology. Users calling the Service Desk
should be able to speak to someone who is able to
address their needs, and Service Desk Analysts should
not be burned out in less than a year because of
undue stress. Care should be taken to select
appropriately skilled individuals with a good
understanding of the business and to provide
adequate training – thus preventing reduction in levels
of support due to a lack of knowledge at the first line.

6.2.2 Service Desk objectives
The primary aim of the Service Desk is to restore the
‘normal service’ to the users as quickly as possible. In this
context ‘restoration of service’ is meant in the widest
possible sense. While this could involve fixing a technical
fault, it could equally involve fulfilling a service request or
answering a query – anything that is needed to allow the
users to return to working satisfactorily.

Specific responsibilities will include:

■ Logging all relevant incident/service request details,

allocating categorization and prioritization codes

■ Providing first-line investigation and diagnosis
■ Resolving those incidents/service requests they 

are able

■ Escalating incidents/service requests that they cannot

resolve within agreed timescales

■ Keeping users informed of progress
■ Closing all resolved incidents, requests and other calls
■ Conducting customer/user satisfaction call-

backs/surveys as agreed

■ Communication with users – keeping them informed

of incident progress, notifying them of impending
changes or agreed outages, etc.

■ Updating the CMS under the direction and approval of

Configuration Management if so agreed.

Organizing for Service Operation  | 111

Note: these activities are explained and set in context with
the fuller Incident Management and Request Fulfilment
process in sections 4.2 and 4.3 respectively.

6.2.3 Service Desk organizational structure
There are many ways of structuring Service Desks and
locating them – and the correct solution will vary for
different organizations. The primary options are detailed
below, but in reality an organization may need to
implement a structure that combines a number of these
options in order to fully meet the business needs:

6.2.3.1 Local Service Desk
This is where a desk is co-located within or physically
close to the user community it serves. This often aids
communication and gives a clearly visible presence, which
some users like, but can often be inefficient and expensive
to resource as staff are tied up waiting to deal with
incidents when the volume and arrival rate of calls may
not justify this.

There may, however, be some valid reasons for
maintaining a local desk, even where call volumes alone
do not justify this. Reasons might include:

■ Language and cultural or political differences
■ Different time zones

■ Specialized groups of users
■ The existence of customized or specialized services

that require specialist knowledge

■ VIP/criticality status of users.

6.2.3.2 Centralized Service Desk
It is possible to reduce the number of Service Desks by
merging them into a single location (or into a smaller
number of locations) by drawing the staff into one or
more centralized Service Desk structures. This can be more
efficient and cost-effective, allowing fewer overall staff to
deal with a higher volume of calls, and can also lead to
higher skill levels through great familiarization through
more frequent occurrence of events. It might still be
necessary to maintain some form of ‘local presence’ to
handle physical support requirements, but such staff can
be controlled and deployed from the central desk.

6.2.3.3 Virtual Service Desk
Through the use of technology, particularly the Internet,
and the use of corporate support tools, it is possible to
give the impression of a single, centralized Service Desk
when in fact the personnel may be spread or located in
any number or type of geographical or structural locations.
This brings in the option of ‘home working’, secondary
support group, off-shoring or outsourcing – or any

combination necessary to meet user demand. It is
important to note, however, that safeguards are needed in
all of these circumstances to ensure consistency and
uniformity in service quality and cultural terms.

6.2.3.4 Follow the Sun
Some global or international organizations may wish to
combine two or more of their geographically dispersed
Service Desks to provide a 24-hour follow-the-sun service.
For example, a Service Desk in Asia-Pacific may handle
calls during its standard office hours and at the end of this
period it may hand over responsibility for any open
incidents to a European-based desk. That desk will handle
these calls alongside its own incidents during its standard
day and then hand over to a USA-based desk – which
finally hands back responsibility to the Asia-Pacific desk to
complete the cycle.

This can give 24-hour coverage at relatively low cost, as
no desk has to work more than a single shift. However,
the same safeguards of common processes, tools, shared
database of information and culture must be addressed for
this approach to proceed – and well-controlled escalation
and handover processes are needed.

6.2.3.5 Specialized Service Desk groups
For some organizations it might be beneficial to create
‘specialist groups’ within the overall Service Desk structure,
so that incidents relating to a particular IT service can be
routed directly (normally via telephony selection or a web-
based interface) to the specialist group. This can allow
faster resolution of these incidents, through greater
familiarity and specialist training.

The selection would be made using a script along the
lines of ‘If your call is about the X Service, please press 1
now, otherwise please hold for a Service Desk analyst’.

Care is needed not to over complicate the selection, so
specialist groups should only be considered for a very
small number of key services where these exist, and 
where call rates about that service justify a separate
specialist group.

6.2.3.6 Environment
The environment where the Service Desk is to be located
should be carefully chosen. Where possible, the following
facilities should be provided:

■ A quiet environment with adequate acoustic control
so that one telephone conversation is not disrupted
by another

■ Pleasant surroundings and comfortable furniture so as

to lighten the mood (the Service Desk can be a very
stressful place to work, so every little helps!)

■ A separate rest-room and refreshment area nearby so
that staff can take short breaks as appropriate when
necessary without being away for too long.

Anecdote

One company found that there was a ‘them and us’
culture existing between the Service Desk and the
other support teams. The third-line teams often
believed themselves to be better than the Service
Desk. Hiding the Service Desk away in an isolated
room helped to reinforce this culture. The company
found that creating an open-plan office with the
Service Desk in the middle encouraged closer
working and helped to break down these barriers.

6.2.3.7 Building a single point of contact
Regardless of the combination of options chosen to fulfil
an organization’s overall Service Desk structure, individual
users should be in no doubt about who to contact if they
need assistance. A single telephone number (or a single
number for each group if separate desks are chosen)
should be provided and well publicized – as well as a
single e-mail address and a single web Service Desk
contact page.

Ideas that can be successfully used to help publicize the
Service Desk telephone number and e-mail address, and
making it available close to hand when users are likely to
need them, are:

■ Including the Service Desk telephone number on

hardware CI labels, attached to the components the
user is likely to be calling about

■ Printing Service Desk contact details on telephones
■ For PCs and laptops, using a customized background

or desktop with the Service Desk contact details,
together with information read from the system that
will be needed when calling (such as IP address, 
OS build number, etc.) in one corner

■ Printing the Service Desk number on ‘freebies’ (pens,

pencils, mugs, mouse-mats, etc.)

■ A location where the entire function can be positioned

■ Prominently placing these details on Service Desk

with sufficient natural light and overall space – to
allow adequate desk and storage-space, and room to
move around if necessary

Internet/intranet sites

114 | Organizing for Service Operation

■ Including them on any calling cards or satisfaction
survey cards left with users when a desk visit has 
been necessary

■ Repeating the details on all correspondence sent to

the users (together with call reference numbers)
■ Placing the details on notice boards or physical

locations that users are likely to regularly visit
(entrances, canteens, refreshment areas, etc.).

6.2.4 Service Desk staffing
The issues involved in, and criteria for, establishing the
appropriate staffing model and levels are discussed in this
section. Details about typical Service Desk roles and
responsibilities can be found in paragraph 6.6.1 below.
They include the Service Desk Manager, Supervisor,
Analysts and, in some organizations, these roles are
complemented by business users (‘Super Users’) who
provide first-line support.

6.2.4.1 Staffing levels
An organization must ensure that the correct number of
staff are available at any given time to match the demand
being placed upon the desk by the business. Call rates can
be very volatile and often in the same day the arrival rate
may go from very high to very low and back again. An
organization planning a new desk should attempt to
predict the call arrival rate and profile – and to staff
accordingly. Statistical analysis of call arrival rates under
current support arrangements must be undertaken and
then closely monitored and adjusted as necessary.

Many organizations will find that call rates peak during the
start of the office day and then fall off quickly, perhaps
with another burst in the early part of the afternoon – this
obviously varies depending upon the organization’s
business but is an often occurring pattern for many
organizations. In such circumstances it may be possible to
utilize part-time staff, home-workers, second-line support
staff or third parties to cover the peaks.

The following factors should be considered when deciding
staffing levels:

■ Customer service expectations
■ Business requirements, such as budget, call response

times, etc.

■ Size, relative age, design and complexity of the IT

Infrastructure and Service Catalogue – for example, the
number and type of incidents, the extent of
customised versus standard off-the-shelf software
deployed, etc.

■ The number of customers and users to support, and

associated factors such as:

● Number of customers and users speaking a

different language

● Skill level

■ Incident and Service Request types (and types of RFC

if appropriate):
● Duration of time required for call types (e.g. simple

queries, specialist application queries, hardware,
etc.)

● Local or external expertise required
● The volume and types of incidents and Service

Requests

■ The period of support cover required, based on:

● Hours covered
● Out-of-hours support requirements
● Time zones to be covered
● Locations to be supported (particularly if Service

Desk staff also conduct desk-side support)

● Travel time between locations
● Workload pattern of requests (e.g. daily, month

end, etc.)

● The service level targets in place (response levels

etc.)

■ The type of response required:

● Telephone
● E-mail/fax/voicemail/video
● Physical attendance
● Online access/control

■ The level of training required
■ The support technologies available (e.g. phone

systems, remote support tools, etc.)

■ The existing skill levels of staff
■ The processes and procedures in use.

All these items should be carefully considered before
making any decision on staffing levels. This should also be
reflected in the levels of documentation required.
Remember that the better the service, the more the
business will use it.

A number of tools are available to help determine the
appropriate number of staff for the Service Desk. These
workload modelling tools are dependent on detailed ‘local
knowledge’ of the organization such as call volumes and
patterns, service and user profiles, etc.

6.2.4.2 Skill levels
An organization must decide on the level and range of
skills it requires of its Service Desk staff – and then ensure
that these skills are available at the appropriate times.

Organizing for Service Operation  | 115

A range of skill options are possible, starting from a ‘call-
logging’ service only – where staff need only very basic
technical skills – right through to a ‘technical’ Service Desk
where the organization’s most technically skilled staff are
used. In the case of the former, there will be a high
handling but low resolution rate, while in the latter case
this will be reversed.

The decision on the required skills level will often be
driven by target resolution times (agreed with the business
and captured in service level targets), the complexity of
the systems supported and ‘what the business is prepared
to pay’.

the service, the more likely specialist knowledge will be
required on the first call.

Note that first-line resolution rates can be reduced by
effective Problem Management, which will reduce a
number of the simpler, repetitive incidents. In such cases,
although the resolution rates appear to be going down,
the overall service quality will have improved by the
complete removal of many incidents. While this is good, 
if Service Desk staff are paid incentives or bonuses for 
first-call resolution, it could prove disastrous for morale
and process effectiveness unless the bonus threshold 
is reviewed.

There is a strong correlation between response and
resolution targets and costs – generally speaking, the
shorter the target times, the higher the cost because more
resources are required.

Improvements in resolution times/rates should not be left
to chance, but should instead be part of an ongoing
Service Improvement Plan (see the Continual Service
Improvement publication for fuller details).

While there may be instances when business dependency
or criticality make a highly technically skilled desk an
imperative, the optimum and most cost-effective approach
is generally to have a ‘call-logging’ first line of support via
the Service Desk, with quick and effective escalations to
more skilled second-line and third-line resolution groups
where skilled staff can be concentrated and more
effectively utilised (see Incident Management, section 4.2,
for more details and guidance on end-to-end support
structures). However, this basic starting point can be
improved over time by providing the first-line staff with an
effective knowledge-base, diagnostic scripts and
integrated support tools (including a CMS), as well as
ongoing training and awareness, so that first-line
resolution rates can gradually be increased.

This can also be achieved by locating second-level staff on
the Service Desk, effectively creating a two-tier structure.
This has advantages of making second-level staff available
to help deal with peak call periods and to train more
junior personnel, and it will often increase the first-call
resolution rate. However, second-line staff often have
duties outside of the Service Desk – resulting in rosters
having to be managed or second-line staff positions being
duplicated. In addition, having to deal with routine calls
may be demotivating for more experienced staff. A further
potential drawback is that the Service Desk becomes really
good at resolving calls, whereas 
second-line staff should be focused on removing the 
root cause instead.

Another factor to consider when deciding on the skills
requirements for Service Desk staff is the level of
customization or specialization of the supported services.
Standardized services require less specific knowledge to
provide quality customer support. The more specialized

Once the required skill levels have been identified, there is
an ongoing task to ensure that the Service Desk is
operated in such a way that the necessary staff obtain and
maintain the necessary skills – and that staff with the
correct balance of skills are on duty at appropriate times
so that consistency is maintained.

This will involve an ongoing training and awareness
programme which should cover:

■ Interpersonal skills: such as telephony skills,

communication skills, active listening and customer-
care training.

■ Business awareness: specific knowledge of the
organization’s business areas, drivers, structure,
priorities, etc.

■ Service awareness of all the organization’s key IT

services for which support is being provided

■ Technical awareness (and deeper technical training to
the appropriate level, depending upon the resolution
rate sought)

■ Depending on level of support provided, some

diagnosis skills (e.g. Kepner and Tregoe)

■ Support tools and techniques
■ Awareness training and tutorials in new systems and

technologies, prior to their introduction

■ Processes and procedures (most particularly Incident,

Change and Configuration Management – but an
overview of all ITSM processes and procedures)

■ Typing skills to ensure quick and accurate entry of

incident or Service Request details.

For such a programme to be effective, skill requirements
and levels should be evaluated periodically and training
records maintained.

116 | Organizing for Service Operation

Careful formulation of staffing rotations or schedules
should be maintained so that a consistent balance of staff
experience and appropriate skill levels are present during
all critical operational periods. It is not sufficient to have
only the right number of staff on duty – the correct blend
of skills should also be available.

6.2.4.3 Training
It is vital that all Service Desk staff are adequately trained
before they are called upon to staff the Service Desk. A
formal induction programme should be undertaken by all
new staff, the exact content of which will vary depending
upon the existing skill levels and experience of the new
recruit, but is likely to include many of the required skills
as described above.

Where possible, a business awareness programme,
including short periods of secondment into key business
areas, should be provided for new staff who do not
already have this level of business awareness.

When starting on the Service Desk, new staff should
initially ‘shadow’ experienced staff – sit with them and
listen in on calls – before starting to take calls themselves
with a mentor listening in and able to intervene and
provide support where necessary. The mentor should
initially review each call with the trainee after it concludes
to learn any lessons. The frequency of such reviews should
be gradually reduced as experience and confidence grows
but the mentor should still be available to provide
ongoing support even when the trainee has reached the
stage of going solo.

Mentors may need to be trained on how to mentor.
Service Desk experience and technical skills are not the
only requirements for mentoring. Effective knowledge-
transfer skills and the ability to teach without being
condescending or threatening are equally important.

A programme will be necessary to keep Service Desk staff’s
knowledge up to date – and to make them aware of new
developments, services and technologies. The timing of
such events is critical so as not to impact upon the normal
duties. Many Service Desks find that it is best to organize
short ‘tutorials’ during quiet periods when staff are less
likely to be needed for call handling.

Note: Investment should also be made in the professional
development of Service Desk staff. Internal mentoring and
shadowing second- and third-level support staff is a good
start, but best-of-breed Service Desks benefit from a
formalized programme of staff development.
Organizational commitment to professional development
helps instil a sense of accomplishment and opportunity to

staff. This often leads to innovation in Service Desk
operation (such as specialized services) which in turn drive
operational efficiencies at all tier levels of support. It helps
to build skills that can be used in their current role as well
as it jump-starts the training for a new role. While it is
important to develop their core competencies in their
current role, having a clear career path and recognising
future requirement and development needs is also
important.

6.2.4.4 Staff retention
It is very important that all IT Managers recognize the
importance of the Service Desk and the staff who work on
it, and give this special attention. Any significant loss of
staff can be disruptive and lead to inconsistency of service
– so efforts should be made to make the Service Desk an
attractive place to work.

Ways in which this can be done include proper
recognition of the role with reward packages recognizing
this, team-building exercises, staff rotation onto other
activities (projects, second-line support, etc.).

The Service Desk can often be used as a stepping stone
into other more technical or supervisory/managerial roles.
If this is done, care is needed to ensure that proper
succession planning takes place so that the desk does not
lose all of its key expertise in any area at one time. Also,
good documentation and cross-training can mitigate this
risk.

6.2.4.5 Super Users
Many organizations find it useful to appoint or designate a
number of ‘Super Users’ throughout the user community,
to act as liaison points with IT in general and the Service
Desk in particular.

Super Users can be given some additional training and
awareness and used as a conduit for communications flow
in both directions. They can be asked to filter requests and
issues raised by the user community (in some cases even
going as far as to have incidents or requests raised by the
Super User) – this can help prevent ‘incident storms’ when
a key service or component fails, affecting many users.

They can also be used to cascade information from the
Service Desk outwards throughout their local user
community, which can be very useful in disseminating
service details to all users very quickly.

It is important to note that Super Users should log all calls
that they deal with, and not just those that they pass on
to IT. This will mean access to, and training on how to use,
the Incident logging tools. This will help to measure the

Organizing for Service Operation  | 117

activity of the Super User and also to ensure that their
position is not abused. In addition, it will ensure that
valuable history regarding incidents and service quality are
not lost.

It may also be possible for Super Users to be involved in:

■ Staff training for users in their area
■ Providing support for minor incidents or simple

request fulfilment

■ Involvement with new releases and rollouts.

Super Users do not necessarily provide support for the
whole of IT. In many cases a Super User will only provide
support for a specific application, module or business unit
area. As a business user the Super User often has in-depth
knowledge of how key business processes run and how
services work in practice. This is very useful knowledge to
share with the Service Desk, so that it can provide higher-
quality services in future.

It should be noted that a firm commitment is needed from
potential Super Users, and specifically their management,
that they will have the time and interest to perform this
role before selection and training commences.

A Super User, while a valuable interface to the business
and the Service Desk, must be given proper training,
accountability and expectation. Super Users can be
vulnerable to misuse if their role, responsibilities and 
the process governing these are not clearly communicated
to the users. It is imperative that a Super User is not seen
as a replacement for, or a means to circumvent, the
Service Desk.

6.2.5 Service Desk metrics
Metrics should be established so that performance of the
Service Desk can be evaluated at regular intervals. This is
important to assess the health, maturity, efficiency,
effectiveness and any opportunities to improve Service
Desk operations.

Metrics for Service Desk performance must be realistic and
carefully chosen. It is common to select those metrics that
are easily available and that may seem to be a possible
indication of performance; however, this can be
misleading. For example, the total number of calls
received by the Service Desk is not in itself an indication
of either good or bad performance and may in fact be
caused by events completely outside the control of the
Service Desk – for example a particularly busy period for
the organization, or the release of a new version of a
major corporate system.

An increase in the number of calls to the Service Desk can
indicate less reliable services over that period of time –
but may also indicate increased user confidence in a
Service Desk that is maturing, resulting in a higher
likelihood that users will seek assistance rather than try to
cope alone. For this type of metric to be reliable for
reaching either conclusion, further comparison of previous
periods for any Service Desk improvements implemented
since the last measurement baseline, or service reliability
changes, problems, etc. to isolate the true cause for the
increase is needed.

Further analysis and more detailed metrics are therefore
needed and must be examined over a period of time.
These will include the call-handling statistics previously
mentioned under telephony, and additionally:

■ The first-line resolution rate: the percentage of calls

resolved at first line, without the need for escalation to
other support groups. This is the figure often quoted
by organizations as the primary measure of the Service
Desks performance – and used for comparison
purposes with the performance of other desks – but
care is needed when making any comparisons. For
greater accuracy and more valid comparisons this can
be broken down further as follows:
● The percentage of calls resolved during the first

contact with the Service Desk, i.e. while the user is
still on the telephone to report the call

● The percentage of calls resolved by the Service

Desk staff themselves without having to seek
deeper support from other groups. Note: some
desks will choose to co-locate or embed more
technically skilled second-line staff with the Service
Desk (see Incident Management for further details).
In such cases it is important when making
comparisons to also separate out (i) the percentage
resolved by the Service Desk staff alone; and 
(ii) the percentage resolved by the first-line Service
Desk staff and second-line support staff combined.
■ Average time to resolve an incident (when resolved at

first line)

■ Average time to escalate an incident (where first-line

resolution is not possible)

■ Average Service Desk cost of handling an incident.

Two metrics should be considered here:
● Total cost of the Service Desk divided by the

number of calls. This will provide an average figure
which is useful as an index and for planning
purposes but does not accurately represent the
relative costs of different types of calls

118 | Organizing for Service Operation

● By calculating the percentage of call duration time

on the desk overall and working out a cost per
minute (total costs for the period divided by total
call duration minutes’) this can be used to
calculate the cost for individual calls and give a
more accurate figure.

By evaluating the types of incidents with call duration,
a more refined picture of cost per call by types arises
and gives an indication of which incident types tend
to cost more to resolve and possible targets for
improvements.

■ Percentage of customer or user updates conducted

within target times, as defined in SLA targets

■ Average time to review and close a resolved call
■ The number of calls broken down by time of day and

day of week, combined with the average call-time
metric, is critical in determining the number of staff
required.

Further general details on metrics and how they should be
used to drive forward service quality is included in the
Continual Service Improvement publication.

6.2.5.1 Customer/user satisfaction surveys
As well as tracking the ‘hard’ measures of the Service
Desk’s performance (via the metrics described above), it is
also important to assess ‘soft’ measures – such as how
well the customers and users feel their calls have been
answered, whether they feel the Service Desk operator was

Table 6.1 Survey techniques and tools

courteous and professional, whether they instilled
confidence in the user.

This type of measure is best obtained from the users
themselves. This can be done as part of a wider
customer/user satisfaction survey covering all of IT or can
be specifically targeted at Service Desk issues alone.

One effective way of achieving the latter is through a call-
back telephone survey, where an independent Service
Desk Operator or Supervisor rings back a small percentage
of users shortly after their incident has been resolved, to
ask the specific questions needed.

Care should be taken to keep the number of questions to
a minimum (five to six at the most) so that the users will
have the time to cooperate. Also survey questions should
be designed so that the user or customer knows what area
or subject questions are about and which incident or
service they are referring to. The Service Desk must act on
low satisfaction levels and any feedback received.

To allow adequate comparisons, the same percentage of
calls should be selected in each period and they should be
rigorously carried out despite any other time pressures.

Surveys are a complex and specialized area, requiring a
good understanding of statistics and survey techniques.
This publication will not attempt to provide an overview
of all of these, but a summary of some of the more widely
used techniques and tools is listed in Table 6.1.

6.2.6 Outsourcing the Service Desk
The decision to outsource is a strategic issue for senior
managers – and is addressed in detail in the Service
Strategy and Service Design publications. Many of the
guidelines in this section are not unique to the Service
Desk and can be applied to any function, support area or
service being outsourced (or out-tasked).

Regardless of the reasons for, or the extent of, the
outsourcing contract, it is vital that the organization
retains responsibility for the activities and services
provided by the Service Desk. The organization is
ultimately responsible for the outcomes of the decision

and must therefore determine what service the outsourcer
provides, not the other way round.

If the outsourcing route is chosen, there are some
safeguards that are needed to ensure that the outsourced
Service Desk works effectively and efficiently with the
organization’s other IT teams and departments and that
end-to-end Service Management control is maintained
(this is particularly important for organizations seeking
ISO/IEC 20000 certification as overall management control
has to be demonstrated). Some of these safeguards are set
out below.

120 | Organizing for Service Operation

6.2.6.1 Common tools and processes
The Service Desk does not have responsibility for all the
processes and procedures that it initiates. For example, a
Service Request is received by the Service Desk but the
request is fulfilled by the internal IT Operational team.

If the Service Desk is outsourced, care must be taken that
the tools are consistent with those still being used in the
customer organization. Outsourcing is often seen as an
opportunity to replace outdated or inadequate tools, only
to find that there are severe integration problems between
the new tool and the legacy tools and processes.

For this reason it is important to ensure that these issues
are properly researched and the customer’s requirements
are adequately scoped and specified before the
outsourcing contract. Service Desk tools must not only
support the outsourced Service Desk, but they must
support the customer organization’s processes and
business requirements as well.

Ideally the outsourced desk should use the same tools and
processes (or, as a minimum, interfacing tools and
processes) to allow smooth process flow between the
Service Desk and second- and third-line support groups.

In addition, the outsourced Service Desk should have
access to:

■ All incident records and information
■ Problem Records and information
■ Known Error Data
■ Change Schedule
■ Sources of internal knowledge (especially technical or

application experts)

■ SKMS
■ CMS
■ Alerts from monitoring tools.

It is often a challenge integrating processes and tools in a
less mature organization with those in a more mature
organization. A common but incorrect assumption is that
the maturity of the one organization will somehow result
in higher maturity in the other. Active involvement to
ensure alignment of processes and tools is essential to a
smooth transition and ongoing management of services
between the internal and external organizations. In fact, if
this is not directly addressed, it could result in the failure
of the contract.

It is also often incorrectly assumed that the proof of
Service Management quality and maturity in an external
outsource partner can be guaranteed by stating
requirements in the procurement process for ‘ITIL
conformance’ and / or ‘ISO/IEC 20000 certification’. These

statements may indicate that a potential supplier uses the
ITIL Framework in its delivery of services to customers, or
that they have achieved standards certification for their
internal practices, but it is equally important to have the
enabling technology in place and being used that
demonstrates a service provider’s capability to manage
services and interface to internal practices harmoniously.
There is no standard of compliance that ensures this and
so procurement efforts should include specific queries to
satisfy this requirement. More information on outsource
provider acquisition can be found in the Service Design
publication.

6.2.6.2 SLA targets
The SLA targets for overall incident-handling and
resolution times need to be agreed with the customers
and between all teams and departments – and OLA/UC
targets need to be coordinated and agreed with individual
support groups so that they underpin and support the 
SLA targets.

Examples of these can be seen in the section on metrics
above (see section 6.2.5).

6.2.6.3 Good communications
The lines of communication between the outsourced
Service Desk and the other support groups need to work
very effectively. This can be assisted by some or all of the
following steps:

■ Close physical co-location
■ Regular liaison/review meetings
■ Cross-training tutorials between the teams and

departments

■ ‘Partnership’ arrangements when staff from both

organizations are used jointly to staff the desk

■ Communication Plans and performance targets are

documented in a consistent manner in OLAs and UCs.

In cases where the Service Desk is located off-shore, not all
of these measures will be possible. However, the need for
training and communication of the Service Desk staff is
still critical, even more so in cases where there are
language and cultural differences.

This will be covered in more detail in ITIL complementary
publications, but, as a rule, outsourcing companies who
offer off-shore Service Desk solutions should take the
following into account:

■ Training programmes focused on cultural

understanding of the customer market

■ Language skills – especially the understanding of

idiomatic use of the language in the customer market.

Organizing for Service Operation  | 121

This is not so that the Service Desk staff sound like
natives of the customer’s country (that type of
insincerity is very quickly detected by customers), but
to facilitate better understanding of the customer and
the better to appreciate their priorities

■ It provides the actual resources to support the ITSM
Lifecycle. In this role Technical Management ensures
that resources are effectively trained and deployed to
design, build, transition, operate and improve the
technology required to deliver and support IT services.

■ Regular visits by representatives of the customer
organization to provide training and appropriate
feedback directly to the Service Desk management
and staff

■ Training in the use of the customer organizations tools

and methods of work. This is especially effective if
similar training materials are presented by the same
instructors as those used by the customer
organization.

6.2.6.4 Ownership of data
Clear ownership of the data collected by the outsourced
Service Desk must be established. Ownership of all data
relative to users, customers, affected CIs, services,
incidents, Service Requests, changes, etc. must remain
with the organization that is outsourcing the activity –
but both organizations will require access to it.

Data that is related specifically to performance of
employees of the outsourcing company will remain the
property of that company, which is often legally prevented
from sharing the data with the customer organization. This
may also be true of other data that is used purely for the
internal management of the Service Desk, such as head
count, optimization activities, Service Desk cost
information, etc.

All reporting requirements and issues around ownership of
data must be specified in the underpinning contract with
the company providing the outsourcing service.

6.3 TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT

Technical Management refers to the groups, departments
or teams that provide technical expertise and overall
management of the IT Infrastructure.

6.3.1 Technical Management role
Technical Management plays a dual role:

■ It is the custodian of technical knowledge and

expertise related to managing the IT Infrastructure.
In this role, Technical Management ensures that the
knowledge required to design, test, manage and
improve IT services is identified, developed and
refined.

By performing these two roles, Technical Management is
able to ensure that the organization has access to the
right type and level of human resources to manage
technology and, thus, to meet business objectives.
Defining the requirements for these roles starts in Service
Strategy and is expanded in Service Design, validated in
Service Transition and refined in Continual Service
Improvement (see other ITIL publications in this series).

Part of this role is also to ensure a balance between the
skill level, utilization and the cost of these resources. For
example, hiring a top-level resource at the higher end of
the salary scale and then only using that skill for 10% of
the time is not effective. A better Technical Management
strategy would be to identify the times that the skill is
needed and then hire a contractor for only those tasks.

Another strategy in larger organizations is to leverage
specialist staff out of ‘central’ pools so that specialists can
be well utilized and provide an economy of scale to the
organization and minimize the need to hire in contractors.
Specialized skills should be identified among resources in
the IT organization, then leveraged for specific needs as
they arise, analogous to a special tactical unit, whose
members also perform regular duties but who are
assigned to tasks needing their specialized skills. This type
of resource utilization is particularly useful both for project
teams and problem resolution.

An additional, but very important role played by Technical
Management is to provide guidance to IT Operations
about how best to carry out the ongoing operational
management of technology. This role is partly carried out
during the Service Design process, but it is also a part of
everyday communication with IT Operations Management
as they seek to achieve stability and optimum
performance.

The objectives, activities and structures that enable
Technical Management to perform these roles effectively
are discussed below.

6.3.2 Technical Management objectives
The objectives of Technical Management are to help plan,
implement and maintain a stable technical infrastructure
to support the organization’s business processes through:

■ Well designed and highly resilient, cost-effective

technical topology

122 | Organizing for Service Operation

■ The use of adequate technical skills to maintain the

technical infrastructure in optimum condition

■ Swift use of technical skills to speedily diagnose and

resolve any technical failures that do occur.

6.3.3 Generic Technical Management
activities
Technical Management is involved in two types of activity:

■ Activities that are generic to the Technical

Management function as a whole are discussed in this
section as they enable Technical Management as a
function to execute its role.

■ A set of discrete activities and processes, which are

performed by all three functions of Technical,
Application and IT Operations Management, are
covered in Chapter 5.

Generic Technical Management activities are highlighted
as follows:

■ Identifying the knowledge and expertise required to

manage and operate the IT Infrastructure and to
deliver IT services. This process starts during the
Service Strategy phase, is expanded in detail in Service
Design and is executed in Service Operation. Ongoing
assessment and updating of these skills is done during
Continual Service Improvement.

■ Documentation of the skills that exist in the

organization, as well as those skills that need to be
developed. This will include the development of 
Skills Inventories and the performance of Training
Needs Analyses.

■ Initiating training programmes to develop and refine
the skills in the appropriate technical resources and
maintaining training records for all technical resources.

■ Design and delivery of training for users, the Service

Desk and other groups. Although training
requirements must be defined in Service Design, they
are executed in Service Operation. Where Technical
Management does not deliver training, it is responsible
for identifying organizations that can provide it.

■ Recruiting or contracting resources with skills that
cannot be developed internally, or where there are
insufficient people to perform the required Technical
Management activities.

■ Procuring skills for specific activities where the
required skills are not available internally or in 
the open market, or where it is more cost-efficient 
to do so.

■ Definition of standards used in the design of new
architectures and participation in the definition of

technology architectures during the Service Strategy
and Design phases.

■ Research and development of solutions that can help
expand the Service Portfolio or which can be used to
simplify or automate IT Operations, reduce costs or
increase levels of IT service.

■ Involvement in the design and building of new

services. Technical Management will contribute to the
design of the Technical Architecture and Performance
standards for IT services. In addition, it will also be
responsible for specifying the operational activities
required to manage the IT Infrastructure on an
ongoing basis.

■ Involvement in projects, not only during Service

Design and Service Transition, but also for Continual
Service Improvement or operational projects, such as
Operating System upgrades, server consolidation
projects or physical moves.

■ Availability and Capacity Management are dependent
on Technical Management for engineering IT services
to meet the levels of service required by the business.
This means that modelling and workload forecasting
are often done with Technical Management resources.
■ Assistance in assessing risk, identifying critical service

and system dependencies and defining and
implementing countermeasures.

■ Designing and performing tests for the functionality,

performance and manageability of IT services.

■ Managing vendors. Many Technical Management

departments or groups are the only ones who know
exactly what is required of a vendor and how to
measure and manage them. For this reason, many
organizations rely on Technical Management
departments to manage contracts with vendors of
specific CIs. If this is the case it is important to ensure
that these relationships are managed as part of the
SLM process.

■ Definition and management of Event Management

standards and tools. Technical Management will also
monitor and respond to many categories of events.
■ Technical Management departments or groups are

integral to the performance of Incident Management.
They receive incidents through Functional Escalation
and provide second- and higher-level support. They
are also involved in maintaining categories and
defining the escalation procedures that are executed
in Incident Management.

■ Technical Management as a function provides the
resources that execute the Problem Management
process. It is its technical expertise and knowledge
that is used to diagnose and resolve problems. It is

Organizing for Service Operation  | 123

also its relationship with the vendors that is used to
escalate and follow up with vendor support teams.
■ Technical Management resources will be involved in

defining coding systems that are used in Incident and
Problem Management (e.g. Incident Categories).

■ Technical Management resources are used to support
Problem Management in validating and maintaining
the KEDB.

■ Change Management relies on the technical

knowledge and expertise to evaluate changes, and
many changes will be built by Technical Management.

■ Releases are frequently deployed using Technical

Management resources.

■ Technical Management will provide information for,

and operationally maintain, the Configuration
Management system and its data. This will be done in
cooperation with Application Management to ensure
that the correct CI attributes and relationships are
created from the deployment of services and the
ongoing maintenance over the life of CIs.

Infrastructure. In all but the smallest organizations, where
a single combined team or department may suffice,
separate teams or departments will be needed for each
type of infrastructure being used.

IT Operations Management consists of a number of
technological areas. Each of these requires a specific set of
skills to manage and operate it. Some skill sets are related
and can be performed by generalists, whereas others are
specific to a component, system or platform.

The primary criterion of Technical Management
organizational structure is that of specialization or division
of labour. The principle is that people are grouped
according to their technical skill sets, and that these skill
sets are determined by the technology that needs to 
be managed.

Sections 6.6 and 6.7 cover the organizational aspects of
Technical Management in detail, but this list provides
some examples of typical Technical Management teams 
or departments:

■ Technical Management is involved in the Continual

■ Mainframe team or department – if one or more

Service Improvement processes, particularly in
identifying opportunities for improvement and then in
helping to evaluate alternative solutions.

■ As a custodian of technical knowledge and expertise,

Technical Management ensures that all system and
operating documentation is up to date and properly
utilized. This includes ensuring that all management,
administration and user manuals are up to date and
complete and that technical staff are familiar with
their contents.

■ Updating and maintaining data used for reporting on

technical and service capabilities, e.g. Capacity and
Performance Management, Availability Management,
Problem Management, etc.

■ Assisting IT Financial Management to identify the cost

of technology and IT human resources used to
manage IT services.

■ Involvement in defining the operational activities

performed as part of IT Operations Management. Many
Technical Management departments, groups or teams
also perform the operational activities as part of an
organization’s IT Operations Management function.

6.3.4 Technical Management organization
Technical Management is not normally provided by a
single department or group. One or more Technical
Support teams or departments will be needed to provide
technical management and support for the IT

mainframe types are still being used by the
organization

■ Server team or department – often split again by
technology types (e.g. Unix server, Wintel server)
■ Storage team or department, responsible for the

management of all data storage devices and media
■ Network Support team or department, looking after

the organization’s internal WANs/LANs and managing
any external network suppliers

■ Desktop team or department, responsible for all

installed desktop equipment

■ Database team or department, responsible for the

creation, maintenance and support of the
organization’s databases

■ Middleware team or department, responsible for the

integration, testing and maintenance of all middleware
in use in the organization

■ Directory Services team or department, responsible for

maintaining access and rights to service elements in
the infrastructure

■ Internet or Web team or department, responsible for

managing the availability and security of access to
servers and content by external customers, users and
partners

■ Messaging team or department, responsible for e-mail

services

■ IP-based Telephony team or department (e.g. VoIP).

124 | Organizing for Service Operation

6.3.5 Technical Design and Technical
Maintenance and Support
Technical Management consists of specialist technical
architects and designers (who are primarily involved
during Service Design) and specialist maintenance 
and support staff (who are primarily involved during
Service Operation).

In this publication, they are viewed as being part of the
same function, but many organizations see them as two
separate teams or even departments. The problem with
this approach is that good design needs input from the
people who are required to manage the solution – and
good operation requires involvement from the people
who designed the solution.

The problems that need to be overcome are similar to
those faced in managing the Application Lifecycle (see
section 6.5 for a more detailed discussion). The solution
will include the following elements:

■ Support staff should be involved during the design or

architecture of a solution. Design staff should be
involved in setting maintenance objectives and
resolving support issues.

■ A change in how both Design and Support staff are

measured. Designers should be held partly
accountable for design flaws that create operational
outages. Support staff should be held partly
accountable for contribution to the technical
architecture.

6.3.6 Technical Management metrics
Metrics for Technical Management will largely depend on
which technology is being managed, but some generic
metrics include:

■ Measurement of agreed outputs. These could

include:
● Contribution to achievement of services to the

business. Although many of the Technical
Management teams will not be in direct contact
with the business, the technology they manage
impacts the business. Metrics should reflect both
negative (incidents traced to their team) and
positive (system performance and availability)
contributions

● Transaction rates and availability for critical

business transactions
● Service Desk training
● Recording problem resolutions into the KEDB
● User measures of the quality of outputs as defined

in the SLAs

● Installation and configuration of components under

their control.

■ Process metrics. Technical Management teams

execute many Service Management process activities.
Their ability to do so will be measured as part of the
process metrics where appropriate (see section on
each process for more details). Examples include:
● Response time to events and event completion

rates

● Incident resolution times for second- and third-line

support

● Problem resolution statistics
● Number of escalations and reason for those

escalations

● Number of changes implemented and backed out
● Number of unauthorized changes detected
● Number of releases deployed, total and successful
● Security issues detected and resolved
● Actual system utilization against Capacity Plan

forecasts (where the team has contributed to the
development of the plan)

● Tracking against SIPs
● Expenditure against budget.

■ Technology performance. These metrics are based

on Service Design specifications and technical
performance standards set by vendors, and will
typically be contained in OLAs or Standard Operation
Procedures. Actual metrics will vary by technology, but
are likely to include:
● Utilization rates (e.g. memory or processor for

server, bandwidth for networks, etc.)

● Availability (of systems, network, devices, etc.),
which is helpful for measuring team or system
performance, but is not to be confused with
Service Availability – which requires the ability to
measure the overall availability of the service and
may use the availability figures for a number of
individual systems or components

● Performance (e.g. response times, queuing 

rates, etc.).

■ Mean Time Between Failures of specified

equipment. This metric is used to ensure that good
purchasing decisions are being made and, when
compared with maintenance schedules, whether the
equipment is being properly maintained

■ Measurement of maintenance activity, including:

● Maintenance performed per schedule
● Number of maintenance windows exceeded
● Maintenance objectives achieved (number and

percentage).

Organizing for Service Operation  | 125

■ Training and skills development. These metrics

ensure that staff have the skills and training to
manage the technology that is under their control,
and will also identify areas where training is still
required.

6.3.7 Technical Management documentation
Technical Management is involved in drafting and
maintaining several documents as part of other processes
(e.g. Capacity Planning, Change Management, Problem
Management, etc.). These documents are discussed in
some detail in the relevant process descriptions. However,
there are some documents that are specific to the
Technical Management groups or teams who will provide
document management and control for documents
relating to the technology under their control. Technical
Management documentation includes the following.

6.3.7.1 Technical documentation
The sourcing and maintenance of technical
documentation for all CIs is the responsibility of Technical
Management. These include:

■ Technical manuals
■ Management and administration manuals
■ User manuals for CIs. These will typically exclude

application user manuals, which are maintained by
Application Management.

6.3.7.2 Maintenance Schedules
These schedules are drawn up and agreed during the
Service Design phase related to Availability and Capacity
Management, but they are essentially the property of the
various Technical Management departments, groups or
teams. This is because they have the technical expertise
for specific technologies and are most likely to know what
is needed to keep them in working order.

For more details on the definition of Maintenance
Schedules and Service Maintenance Objectives, refer to the
ITIL Service Design publication.

6.3.7.3 Skills Inventory
A Skills Inventory is a system or tool that identifies the
skills required to deliver and support IT services and also
the individuals who possess those skills. Skills Inventories
are most effective if they are aligned with processes,
architectures and performance standards.

In addition, Skills Inventories should identify the training
available to cultivate each skill should existing staff leave
the organization.

Skills Inventories can also be used as part of the Service
Portfolio to assess whether a new service can be delivered
with existing staff and skill sets, or whether an investment
needs to be made in new staff or training. Skills
Inventories can therefore contribute significantly to
Capacity Planning.

The definition and maintenance of Skills Inventories
requires a good interface with Human Resource processes
and tools in the organization.

6.4 IT OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT

In business, the term ‘Operations Management’ is used to
mean the department, group or team of people
responsible for performing the organization’s day-to-day
operational activities – such as running the production line
in a manufacturing environment or managing the
distribution centres and fleet movements within a logistics
organization.

Operations Management generally has the following
characteristics: 

■ There is work to ensure that a device, system or

process is actually running or working (as opposed to
strategy or planning)

■ This is where plans are turned into actions
■ The focus is on daily or shorter-term activities,

although it should be noted that these activities 
will generally be performed and repeated over a
relatively long period (as opposed to one-off project
type activities)

■ These activities are executed by specialized technical
staff, who often have to undergo technical training to
learn how to perform each activity

■ There is a focus on building repeatable, consistent
actions that – if repeated frequently enough at the
right level of quality – will ensure the success of 
the operation

■ This is where the actual value of the organization is

delivered and measured

■ There is a dependency on investment in equipment 

or human resources or both

■ The value generated, must exceed the cost of the
investment and all other organizational overheads
(such as management and marketing costs) if the
business is to succeed.

In a similar way, IT Operations Management can be
defined as the function responsible for the ongoing
management and maintenance of an organization’s IT
Infrastructure to ensure delivery of the agreed level of IT
services to the business.

126 | Organizing for Service Operation

IT Operations can be defined as the set of activities
involved in the day-to-day running of the IT Infrastructure
for the purpose of delivering IT services at agreed levels to
meet stated business objectives.

6.4.1 IT Operations Management role
The role of Operations Management is to execute the
ongoing activities and procedures required to manage and
maintain the IT Infrastructure so as to deliver and support
IT Services at the agreed levels. These have already been
described in section 5, but are summarized here for
completeness:

■ Operations Control, which oversees the execution

and monitoring of the operational activities and events
in the IT Infrastructure. This can be done with the
assistance of an Operations Bridge or Network
Operations Centre. In addition to executing routine
tasks from all technical areas, Operations Control also
performs the following specific tasks:
● Console Management, which refers to defining

central observation and monitoring capability and
then using those consoles to exercise monitoring
and control activities

● Job Scheduling, or the management of routine

batch jobs or scripts

● Backup and Restore on behalf of all Technical

and Application Management teams and
departments and often on behalf of users

● Print and Output management for the collation

and distribution of all centralized printing or
electronic output

● Performance of maintenance activities on behalf
of Technical or Application Management teams or
departments.

■ Facilities Management, which refers to the

management of the physical IT environment, typically
a Data Centre or computer rooms and recovery sites
together with all the power and cooling equipment.
Facilities Management also includes the coordination
of large-scale consolidation projects, e.g. Data Centre
consolidation or server consolidation projects. In some
cases the management of a data centre is outsourced,
in which case Facilities Management refers to the
management of the outsourcing contract.

As with many IT Service Management processes and
functions, IT Operations Management plays a dual role.

■ IT Operations Management is responsible for executing

the activities and performance standards defined
during Service Design and tested during Service
Transition. In this sense IT Operations’ role is primarily
to maintain the status quo. The stability of the IT

infrastructure and consistency of IT Services is a
primary concern of IT Operations. Even operational
improvements are aimed at finding simpler and better
ways of doing the same thing.

■ At the same time, IT Operations is part of the process
of adding value to the different lines of business and
to support the value network (see the ITIL Service
Strategy publication). The ability of the business to
meet its objectives and to remain competitive
depends on the output and reliability of the day-to-
day operation of IT. As such, IT Operations
Management must be able to continually adapt to
business requirements and demand. The Business does
not care that IT Operations complied with a standard
procedure or that a server performed optimally. As
business demand and requirements change, IT
Operations Management must be able to keep pace
with them, often challenging the status quo.

IT Operations must achieve a balance between these roles,
which will require the following:

■ An understanding of how technology is used to

provide IT services

■ An understanding of the relative importance and

impact of those services on the business

■ Procedures and manuals that outline the role of IT
Operations in both the management of technology
and the delivery of IT services

■ A clearly differentiated set of metrics to report to the

business on the achievement of Service objectives; and
to report to IT managers on the efficiency and
effectiveness of IT Operations

■ All IT Operations staff understand exactly how the

performance of the technology affects the delivery of
IT services

■ A cost strategy aimed at balancing the requirements

of different business units with the cost savings
available through optimization of existing technology
or investment in new technology

■ A value, rather than cost, based Return on Investment

strategy.

6.4.2 IT Operations Management objectives
The objectives of IT Operations Management include:

■ Maintenance of the status quo to achieve stability of
the organization’s day-to-day processes and activities

■ Regular scrutiny and improvements to achieve

improved service at reduced costs, while maintaining
stability

■ Swift application of operational skills to diagnose and

resolve any IT operations failures that occur.

Organizing for Service Operation  | 127

6.4.3 IT Operations Management
organization
Figure 6.1 in the introduction to Chapter 6 illustrated that
IT Operations Management is seen as a function in its own
right but that, in many cases, staff from Technical and
Application Management groups form part of this
function.

● Expenditure against budget.

■ If maintenance activities have been delegated, then

metrics related to these activities will also be
appropriate:
● Maintenance performed per schedule
● Number of maintenance windows exceeded
● Maintenance objectives achieved (number and

This means that some Technical and Application
Management departments or groups will manage and
execute their own operational activities. Others will
delegate these activities to a dedicated IT Operations
department.

There is no single method for assigning activities, as it
depends on the maturity and stability of the infrastructure
being managed. For example, Technical and Application
Management areas that are fairly new and unstable tend
to manage their own operations. Groups where the
technology or application is stable, mature and well
understood tend to have standardized their operations
more and will therefore feel more comfortable delegating
these activities.

Some options of how to structure IT Operations are
discussed in detail in section 6.7 of this publication.

6.4.4 IT Operations Management metrics
IT Operations Management is measured in terms of its
effective execution of specified activities and procedures,
as well as its execution of process activities. Examples of
these are as follows:

■ Successful completion of scheduled jobs
■ Number of exceptions to scheduled activities and jobs
■ Number of data or system restores required
■ Equipment installation statistics, including number of

items installed by type, successful installations, etc.

■ Process metrics. IT Operations Management executes

many Service Management process activities. Their
ability to do so will be measured as part of the
process metrics where appropriate (see section on
each process for more details). Examples include:
● Response time to events
● Incident resolution times for incidents
● Number of security-related incidents
● Number of escalations and reason for those

escalations

● Number of changes implemented and backed out
● Number of unauthorized changes detected
● Number of releases deployed, total and successful
● Tracking against SIPs

percentage).

■ Metrics related to Facilities Management are extensive,

but typically include:
● Costs versus budget related to maintenance,

construction, security, shipping, etc.

● Incidents related to the building, e.g. repairs

needed to the facility

● Reports on access to the facility
● Number of security events and Incidents and their

resolution

● Power usage statistics, especially as related to

changes in layout and environmental conditioning
strategies

● Events or incidents related to shipping and

distribution.

6.4.5 IT Operations Management
documentation
A number of documents are produced and used during IT
Operations Management. This list is a summary of some of
the most important and does not include reports that are
produced by IT Operations Management on behalf of
other processes or functions.

6.4.5.1 Standard Operating Procedures
The SOPs are a set of documents containing detailed
instructions and activity schedules for every IT Operations
Management team, department or group.

These documents represent the routine work that needs to
be done for every device, system or procedure. They also
outline the procedures to be followed if an exception is
detected or if a change is required.

SOP documents could also be used to define standard
levels of performance for devices or procedures. In some
organizations the SOP documents are referred to in the
OLA. Instead of listing detailed performance measures in
the OLA, a clause is inserted to refer to the performance
standards in the SOP and how these will be measured and
reported.

128 | Organizing for Service Operation

6.4.5.2 Operations Logs
Any activity that is conducted as part of IT Operations
should be recorded for a number of reasons, including:

■ They can be used to confirm the successful

completion of specific jobs or activities

■ They can be used to confirm that an IT service was

delivered as agreed

■ They can be used by Problem Management to

research the root cause of incidents

■ They are the basis for reports on the performance of

the IT Operations Management teams and
departments.

The format of these logs is as varied as the number 
of systems and Operations Management teams or
departments. Examples of Operations Logs include 
the following:

■ Operating System Logs stored on each device
■ Application Activity Logs stored in a file on the

application server

■ Event Logs stored on the monitoring tool server
■ Utilization Logs for key devices
■ Physical access logs recording who accessed secure

buildings and when

■ Handwritten logs of actions performed by operators.

This must be in a formal logbook or binder, numbered
and stored in a secure environment. Checks should
ensure that pages are not removed.

A policy needs to be established as part of the SOPs to
state how long logs need to be kept, how they are
archived and when they can be deleted. These policies will
take into account statutory and compliance requirements.
Policies should also specify the parameters for adequate
storage and backup strategies to store and retrieve 
log files.

6.4.5.3 Shift Schedules and Reports
Shift Schedules are documents that outline the exact
activities that need to be carried out during the shift. They
will also list all dependencies and activity sequences. There
will probably be more than one Shift Schedule, where
each team will have a version for its own systems. It is
important that all schedules are coordinated before the
start of the shift. This is usually done by a person who is
specialized in Shift Scheduling, with the help of
scheduling tools.

A Shift Schedule could consist of a number of routine
items that are included in the SOP. In this case the items

could simply be listed briefly with a reference to the
section or page in the SOP.

Most Shift Schedules take the form of a checklist where
operators can check off the item as it is completed,
together with the time of completion. This makes it easy
to see the progress of activities and also helps to identify
any potential issues where jobs are taking too long.

Shift Reports are a form of Operations Log, but have the
additional functions as follows:

■ To record major events and actions that occurred

during the shift

■ To form part of the handover between shift leaders
■ To report any exceptions to Service Maintenance

Objectives

■ To identify any uncompleted activity that could result

in degraded performance on any service during the
next service hours.

6.4.5.4 Operations Schedule
The Operations Schedules are similar to Shift Schedules
but cover all aspects of IT Operations at a high level. This
schedule will include an overview of all planned changes,
maintenance, routine jobs and additional work, together
with information about upcoming business or vendor
events. The Operations Schedule is used as the basis for
the Daily Operations Meeting and is the master reference
for all IT Operations managers to track progress and detect
exceptions.

6.5 APPLICATION MANAGEMENT

Application Management is responsible for managing
applications throughout their lifecycle. The Application
Management function is performed by any department,
group or team involved in managing and supporting
operational applications. Application Management also
plays an important role in the design, testing and
improvement of applications that form part of IT services.
As such, it may be involved in development projects, 
but is not usually the same as the Applications
Development teams.

6.5.1 Application Management role
Application Management is to applications what Technical
Management is to the IT Infrastructure. Application
Management plays a role in all applications, whether
purchased or developed in-house. One of the key
decisions that they contribute to is the decision of
whether to buy an application or build it (this is discussed
in detail in the Service Design publication). Once that

Organizing for Service Operation  | 129

decision is made, Application Management will play 
a dual role:

These objectives are achieved through:

■ Applications that are well designed, resilient and 

■ It is the custodian of technical knowledge and

cost-effective

expertise related to managing applications. In this role
Application Management, working together with
Technical Management, ensures that the knowledge
required to design, test, manage and improve IT
services is identified, developed and refined.

■ It provides the actual resources to support the ITSM

Lifecycle. In this role, Application Management ensures
that resources are effectively trained and deployed to
design, build, transition, operate and improve the
technology required to deliver and support IT services.

By performing these two roles, Application Management is
able to ensure that the organization has access to the
right type and level of human resources to manage
applications and thus to meet business objectives. This
starts in Service Strategy and is expanded in Service
Design, tested in Service Transition and refined in
Continual Service Improvement (see other ITIL publications
in this series).

Part of this role is to ensure a balance between the skill
level and the cost of these resources.

In additional to these two high-level roles, Application
Management also performs the following two 
specific roles:

■ Providing guidance to IT Operations about how best
to carry out the ongoing operational management of
applications. This role is partly carried out during the
Service Design process, but it is also a part of
everyday communication with IT Operations
Management as they seek to achieve stability and
optimum performance.

■ The integration of the Application Management

Lifecycle into the ITSM Lifecycle. This is discussed
below.

The objectives, activities and structures that enable
Application Management to play these roles effectively are
discussed below.

6.5.2 Application Management objectives
The objectives of Application Management are to support
the organization’s business processes by helping to
identify functional and manageability requirements for
application software, and then to assist in the design and
deployment of those applications and the ongoing
support and improvement of those applications.

■ Ensuring that the required functionality is available to

achieve the required business outcome

■ The organization of adequate technical skills to

maintain operational applications in optimum
condition

■ Swift use of technical skills to speedily diagnose and

resolve any technical failures that do occur.

6.5.3 Application Management principles

6.5.3.1 Build or buy?
One of the key decisions in Application Management is
whether to buy an application that supports the required
functionality, or whether to build the application
specifically for the organization’s requirements. These
decisions are often made by a Chief Technical Officer
(CTO) or Steering Committee, but they are dependent 
on information from a number of sources. These are
discussed in detail in Service Design, but are 
summarized here from an Application Management
function perspective.

Application Management will assist in this decision during
Service Design as follows:

■ Application sizing and workload forecasts 

(see section 4.6.4)

■ Specification of manageability requirements
■ Identification of ongoing operational costs
■ Data access requirements for reporting or integration

into other applications

■ Investigating to what extent the required functionality

can be met by existing tools – and how much
customization will be required to achieve this

■ Estimating the cost of customization
■ Identifying what skills will be required to support the

solution (e.g. if an application is purchased, will it
require a new set of employees, or can existing
employees be trained to support it?)

■ Administration requirements
■ Security requirements.

If the decision is to build the application, a further
decision needs to be made on whether the development
will be outsourced or built using employees. This is
detailed in the Service Strategy and Service Design
publications, but there are some important considerations
affecting Service Operation, for example:

130 | Organizing for Service Operation

■ How will manageability requirements be specified and

agreed (e.g. designing application and transaction
monitoring)? These are sometimes forgotten when the
operational teams or departments are not represented
in the project

■ What are the Acceptance Criteria for operational

performance; how and where will the solution be
tested and who will perform the tests?

■ Who will own and manage the Definitive Library for

that application?

■ Who will design and maintain the operational

management and administration scripts for these
applications?

■ Who is responsible for environment set-up and

owning and maintaining the different infrastructure
components?

■ How will the solution be instrumented so that it is

capable of generating the required events?

6.5.3.2 Operational Models
An Operational Model is the specification of the
operational environment in which the application will
eventually run when it goes live. This will be used during
testing and transition phases to simulate and evaluate the
live environment. This is a way of ensuring that the
application can be sized correctly and the required
environmental conditions can be documented and
understood by all. The Operational Model should be
defined and used in testing during the Service Design and
Service Transition phases respectively (see Service Design
and Service Transition publications).

6.5.4 Application Management Lifecycle
The lifecycle followed to develop and manage applications
has been referred to by many names, including the
Software Lifecycle (SLC) and Software Development
Lifecycle (SDLC). These are generally used by Applications
Development teams and their Project Managers to define
their involvement in designing, building, testing,
deploying and supporting applications. Examples of these
approaches are Structured Systems Analysis and Design
Methodology (SSADM), Dynamic Systems Development
Method (DSDM), Rapid Application Development (RAD),
etc.

ITIL is primarily interested in the overall management 
of applications as part of IT Services, whether they are
developed in-house or purchased from a third party. 
For this reason, the term Application Management
Lifecycle has been used, as it implies a more holistic view.

This should not replace the SDLC, which is still a valid
approach used by developers, especially by third-party
software companies. However, it does mean that there
should be greater alignment between the development
view of applications and the ‘live’ management of those
applications.

This is more difficult in large-scale purchased applications,
such as e-mail, since the developers do not typically
interact individually with their application’s users.
However, the basic lifecycle still holds true in that the
application needs requirements, design, customization,
operation and deployment. Optimization is achieved
through better management, improvements to
customization and upgrades.

The Application Management Lifecycle is illustrated as
follows:

Requirements

Optimize

Design

Operate

Build

Deploy

Figure 6.5 Application Management Lifecycle

ITSM processes and Applications Development processes
have to be aligned as part of the overall strategy of
delivering IT services in support of the business.

Applications Development and Operations are part of the
same overall lifecycle and both should be involved at all
stages, although their level of involvement will vary
depending on the stage of the lifecycle.

Relationship between the Application
Management and Service Management Lifecycles

The Application Management Lifecycle should not be
seen as an alternative to the Service Management
Lifecycle. Applications are part of services and have to
be managed as such. Nevertheless, applications are a
unique blend of technology and functionality and this
requires a specialized focus at each stage of the
Service Management Lifecycle.

Each stage of the Application Management Lifecycle
has its own specific set of objectives, activities,
deliverables and dedicated teams. Each stage also has
a clear responsibility to ensure that their outputs
match up to the specific objectives of the Service
Management Lifecycle. Different aspects of
Application Management are covered in detail in each
of the ITIL publications, as follows:

■ Service Strategy: Defines the overall architecture
of applications and infrastructure. This will include
defining the criteria for developing in-house,
outsourcing development, or purchasing and
customizing applications. Service Strategy will also
assist in defining the Service Portfolio (including
applications) which also includes information
about the Return on Investment of applications
and the services they support. Thus high-level
requirements are set during this phase.

■ Service Design: Helps to establish requirements

for functionality and manageability of applications
and works with Development teams to ensure
that they meet these objectives. Service Design
covers most of the Requirements phase and is
involved during the Build phase of the Application
Management Lifecycle.

■ Service Transition: Application Development and

Management teams are involved in testing and
validating what has been built and deploying it
operationally.

■ Service Operation: This covers the Operate phase

of the Application Management Lifecycle. These
processes and structures are discussed in detail in
this publication.

■ Continual Service Improvement: Covers the

Optimize phase of the Application Management
Lifecycle. Continual Service Improvement
measures the quality and relevance of applications
in operation and provides recommendations on
how to improve applications if there is a clear
Return on Investment for doing so.

Organizing for Service Operation  | 131

6.5.4.1 Requirements
This is the phase during which the requirements for a new
application are gathered, based on the business needs of
the organization. This phase is active primarily during the
Service Design phase of the ITSM Lifecycle.

There are six types of requirements for any application,
whether being developed in-house, outsourced or
purchased:

■ Functional requirements are those specifically required

to support a particular business function

■ Manageability requirements, looked at from a Service

Management perspective, address the need for a
responsive, available and secure service, and deal with
such issues as deployment, operations, system
management and security

■ Usability requirements are those that address the

needs of the end user, and result in features of the
system that facilitate its ease of use

■ Architectural requirements, especially if this requires a

change to existing architecture standards

■ Interface requirements, where there are dependencies

between existing applications or tools and the new
application

■ Service Level Requirements, which specify how the

service should perform, the quality of its output and
any other qualitative aspects measured by the user or
customer.

6.5.4.2 Design
This is the phase during which requirements are translated
into specifications. Design includes the design of the
application itself, and the design of the environment, or
operational model that the application has to run on.
Architectural considerations are the most important aspect
of this phase, since they can impact on the structure and
content of both application and operational model.
Architectural considerations for the application (design of
the application architecture) and architectural
considerations for the operation model (design of the
system architecture) are strongly related and need to be
aligned.

In the case of purchased software, most organizations will
not be allowed direct input to the design of the software
(which has already been built). However, it is important
that Application Management is able to provide feedback
to the software vendor about the functionality,
manageability and performance of the software. This will,
in turn, be taken up by the software vendor as part of the
continual improvement of the software.

132 | Organizing for Service Operation

Part of the evaluation process for purchased software
should include an evaluation of whether the vendor is
responsive to such feedback. At the same time, they
should ensure that there is a balance between being
responsive and changing their software so much that it is
disruptive or that it changes some basic functionality.

Design for purchased software will also include the design
of any customization that is required. Of special
importance here is an evaluation of whether future version
of the software will support the customization.

6.5.4.3 Build
In the Build phase, both the application and the
operational model are made ready for deployment.
Application components are coded or acquired, integrated
and tested.

Please note that Test is not a separate stage in the
lifecycle, even though it is a discrete activity, and even
though tests are conducted independently of both the
development and operational activities. Without the Build
and Deploy phases, there would be nothing to test and,
without testing, there would be no control over what is
developed and deployed.

Testing is an integral component of both the Build and
Deploy phases as a validation of the activity and output of
those phases – even if it uses different environments and
staff. Testing in the Build phase focuses on whether the
application meets its functionality and manageability
specifications. Often the distinction is made between a
development and test environment. The test environment
allows for testing the combination of application and
operational model. Testing is covered in the ITIL Service
Transition publication.

For purchased software, this will involve the actual
purchase of the application, any required middleware and
the related hardware and networking equipment. Any
customization that is required will need to be done here,
as will the creation of tables, categories, etc. that will be
used. This is often done as a pilot implementation by the
relevant Application Management team or department.

6.5.4.4 Deploy
In this phase, both the operational model and the
application are deployed. The operational model is
incorporated in the existing IT environment and the
application is installed on top of the operational model,
using the Release and Deployment Management process
described in the ITIL Service Transition publication.

Testing also takes place during this phase, although here
the emphasis is on ensuring that the deployment process
and mechanisms work effectively, e.g. testing whether the
application still functions to specification after it has been
downloaded and installed. This is known as Early Life
Support and covers a pre-defined guarantee period that
testing, validation and monitoring of a new application or
service during that period occurs. Early Life Support is
covered in detail in the Service Transition publication.

6.5.4.5 Operate
In the Operate phase, the IT services organization operates
the application as part of delivering a service required by
the business. The performance of the application in
relation to the overall service is measured continually
against the Service Levels and key business drivers. It is
important to distinguish that applications themselves do
not equate to a service. It is common in many
organizations to refer to applications as ‘services’;
however, applications are but one component of many
needed to provide a business service.

The Operate phase is not exclusive to applications and is
discussed throughout this publication, with a more
detailed list of activities given in section 6.5.5 below.

6.5.4.6 Optimize
In the Optimize phase, the results of the Service Level
performance measurements are measured, analysed and
acted upon. Possible improvements are discussed and
developments initiated if necessary. The two main
strategies in this phase are to maintain and/or improve the
Service Levels and to lower cost. This could lead to
iteration in the lifecycle or to justified retirement of an
application.

One important thing to remember about the Application
Management Lifecycle is that, because it is circular, the
same application can reside in different phases of the
lifecycle at the same time. For example, when the next
version of an application is being designed, and the
current version is being deployed, the previous version
might still be in operation in parts of an organization. This
obviously requires strong version, configuration and
release control.

Particular phases might take longer or seem more
significant than others, but they are all crucial. Every
application must go through all of them at least once and,
because of the circular nature of the lifecycle, will go
through some more than once.

This approach also supports iterative development
approaches, where software is continually being

Organizing for Service Operation  | 133

developed in incremental steps. Each step follows the
lifecycle and the application is built in increments, using
business priorities as a driver.

Good communication is the key as an application works its
way through the phases of the lifecycle. It is critical that
high-quality information is passed along by those handling
the application in one phase of its existence to those
handling it in the next phase. It is also important that an
organization monitors the quality of the Application
Management Lifecycle. Changes in the lifecycle, for
example in the way an organization passes information
between the different phases, will affect its quality.
Understanding the characteristics of every phase in the
Application Management Lifecycle is crucial to improving
the quality of the whole. Methods and tools used in one
phase might have an impact on others, while optimization
of one phase might sub-optimize the whole.

6.5.5 Application Management generic
activities
While most Application Management teams or
departments are dedicated to specific applications or sets
of applications, there are a number of activities which they
have in common. These include:

■ Identifying the knowledge and expertise required to

manage and operate applications in the delivery of IT
services. This process starts during the Service Strategy
phase, is expanded in detail in Service Design and is
executed in Service Operation. Ongoing assessment
and updating of these skills are done during Continual
Service Improvement.

■ Initiating training programmes to develop and refine
the skills in the appropriate Application Management
resources and maintaining training records for 
these resources.

■ Recruiting or contracting resources with skills that
cannot be developed internally, or where there are
insufficient people to perform the required Application
Management activities.

■ Design and delivery of end-user training. Training may
be developed and delivered by either the Application
Development or Application Management groups, or
by a third party, but Application Management is
responsible for ensuring that training is conducted 
as appropriate.

■ Insourcing for specific activities where the required

skills are not available internally or in the open market,
or where it is more cost-efficient to do so.

■ Definition of standards used in the design of new
architectures and participation in the definition of

application architectures during the Service Strategy
processes.

■ Research and Development of solutions that can help
expand the Service Portfolio or which can be used to
simplify or automate IT Operations, reduce costs or
increase levels of IT service.

■ Involvement in the design and building of new
services. All Application Management teams or
departments will contribute to the design of the
Technical Architecture and Performance standards for
IT Services. In addition they will also be responsible for
specifying the operational activities required to
manage applications on an ongoing basis.

■ Involvement in projects, not only during the Service

Design process, but also for Continual Service
Improvement or operational projects, such as
Operating System upgrades, server consolidation
projects or physical moves.

■ Designing and performing tests for the functionality,

performance and manageability of IT Services (bearing
in mind that testing should be controlled and
performed by an independent tester – see Service
Transition publication).

■ Availability and Capacity Management are dependent

on Application Management for contributing to the
design of applications to meet the levels of service
required by the business. This means that modelling
and workload forecasting are often done together with
Technical and Application Management resources.

■ Assistance in assessing risk, identifying critical service

and system dependencies and defining and
implementing countermeasures.

■ Managing vendors. Many Application Management

departments or groups are the only ones who know
exactly what is required of a vendor and how to
measure and manage them. For this reason, many
organizations rely on Application Management to
manage contracts with vendors of specific
applications. If this is the case it is important to ensure
that these relationships are managed as part of the
SLM process.

■ Involvement in definition of Event Management

standards and especially in the instrumentation of
applications for the generation of meaningful events.
■ Application Management as a function provides the

resources that execute the Problem Management
process. It is their technical expertise and knowledge
that is used to diagnose and resolve problems. It is
also their relationship with the vendors that is used to
escalate and follow up with vendor support teams or
departments.

134 | Organizing for Service Operation

■ Application Management resources will be involved in
defining coding systems that are used in Incident and
Problem Management (e.g. Incident Categories).
■ Application Management resources are used to
support Problem Management in validating and
maintaining the KEDB together with the Application
Development teams.

■ Change Management relies on the technical

knowledge and expertise to evaluate changes and
many changes will be built by Application
Management teams.

■ Successful Release Management is dependent on

involvement from Application Management staff. In
fact they are frequently the drivers of the Release
Management process for their applications.

■ Application Management will define, manage and

maintain attributes and relationships of application CIs
in the CMS.

■ Application Management is involved in the Continual

Service Improvement processes, particularly in
identifying opportunities for improvement and then in
helping to evaluate alternative solutions.

■ Application Management ensures that all system and
operating documentation is up to date and properly
utilized. This includes ensuring that all design,
management and user manuals are up to date and
complete and that Application Management staff and
users are familiar with their contents.

■ Collaboration with Technical Management on

performing Training Needs Analysis and maintaining
Skills Inventories.

■ Assisting IT Financial Management to identify the cost

of the ongoing management of applications.

■ Involvement in defining the operational activities

performed as part of IT Operations Management. Many
Application Management departments, groups or
teams also perform the operational activities as part of
an organization’s IT Operations Management function.
■ Input into, and maintenance of, software configuration

policies.

■ Together with Software Development teams, the

definition and maintenance of documentation related
to applications. These will include user manuals,
administration and management manuals, as well as
any SOPs required to manage operational aspects of
the application.

Application Management teams or departments will be
needed for all key applications. The exact nature of the
role will vary depending upon the applications being
supported, but generic responsibilities are likely to include:

■ Third-level support for incidents related to the

application(s) covered by that team or department

■ Involvement in operation testing plans and

deployment issues

■ Application bug tracking and patch management

(coding fixes for in-house code, transports/patches for
third-party code)

■ Involvement in application operability and

supportability issues such as error code design, error
messaging, event management hooks

■ Application sizing and performance; volume metrics

and load testing etc. This is in support of Capacity and
Availability Management processes

■ Involvement in developing Release Policies
■ Identification of enhancements to existing software,

both from a functionality and manageability
perspective.

6.5.6 Application Management organization
Although all Application Management departments,
groups or teams perform similar activities, each application
or set of applications has a different set of management
and operational requirements. Examples of these
differences include:

■ The purpose of the application. Each application
was developed to meet a specific set of objectives,
usually business objectives. For effective support and
improvement, the group that manages that
application needs to have a comprehensive
understanding of the business context and how the
application is used to meet its objectives. This is often
achieved by Business Analysts who are close to the
business and responsible for ensuring that business
requirements are effectively translated into application
specifications. Business Analysts should recognize that
business requirements must be translated into both
functional and manageability specifications.
■ The functionality of the application. Each

application is designed to work in a different way and
to perform different functions at different times.
■ The platform on which the application runs.
Although the platform is usually managed by a
Technical Management team or department, each of
them affects the way in which an application needs to
be managed and operated.

■ The type or brand of technology used. Even

applications that have similar functionality operate
differently on different databases or platforms. These
differences have to be understood in order to manage
the application effectively.

Organizing for Service Operation  | 135

Even though the activities to manage these applications
are generic, the specific schedule of activities and the way
they are performed will be different. For this reason,
Application Management teams and departments tend to
be organized according to the categories of applications
that they support. Typical examples of Application
Management organizations include:

■ Financial applications. In larger organizations where a
number of different applications are used for different
aspects of Financial Management, there may be
several department, groups or teams managing these
applications, e.g. Debtors and Creditors, Age Analysis,
General Ledger, etc.

■ Messaging and collaboration applications
■ HR applications
■ Manufacturing support applications

Table 6.2 Organizational roles

■ Sales force automation
■ Sales order processing applications
■ Call centre and marketing applications
■ Business-specific applications (e.g. health care,

insurance, banking, etc.)

■ IT applications, such as Service Desk, Enterprise System

Management, etc.

■ Web portals
■ Online shopping.

6.5.6.1 Organizational roles
Traditionally, Application Development and Management
teams and departments have been autonomous units.
Each one manages its own environment in its own way
and each has a separate interface to the business. This is
illustrated in Table 6.2.

Application Development

Application Management

Primary focus

Building functionality for their customer. What the
application does is more important to them than
how it is operated

Focus on what the functionality is as well as
how to deliver it.

Manageability aspects of the application, 
i.e. how to ensure stability and performance 
of the application

Management mode

Most development work is done in projects where
the focus is on delivering specific units of work to
specification, on time and within budget.

Most work is done as part of repeatable,
ongoing processes. A relatively small number
of people work in projects.

Measurement

Cost

Lifecycles

This means that it is often difficult for developers
to understand and build for ongoing operations,
especially since they are not available for support
of the application once they have moved on to
the next project

Staff are rewarded for creativity and for completing
one project so that they can move on to the next
project

This means that it is very difficult for
operational staff to get involved in
development projects, as that takes them away
from their ‘real jobs’

Staff are rewarded for consistency and for
preventing unexpected events and
unauthorized functionality (e.g. ‘bells and
whistles’ added by developers)

Development projects are relatively easy to
quantify since the resources are known and it is
easy to link their expenses to a specific application
or IT Service

Ongoing management costs are often mixed in
with the costs of other IT services since
resources are often shared across multiple IT
services and applications

Development staff focus on Software
Development Lifecycles, which highlight the
dependencies for successful operation, but do not
assign accountability for these

Staff involved in ongoing management
typically only control one or two phases of
these lifecycles – Operation and Improvement

136 | Organizing for Service Operation

Over the last several years, these two worlds are being
brought together by recent moves to Object Oriented and
SOA approaches, together with growing pressure from the
Business to be more responsive and easy to work with.

This means that Application Development will have
greater accountability for the successful operation of
applications they design, while Application Management
will have greater involvement in the development 
of applications.

This does not change the fundamental role of each group,
but it does require a more integrated approach to the SLC.
It will also mean that the output of Application
Development will be more commoditized and that
Application Management will be more involved in
Development projects.

This will require the following changes:

■ A single interface to the business for all stages of the

lifecycle and a common requirements and
specification-setting process.

■ A change in how both Development and Management

staff are measured. Development teams should be
held partly accountable for design flaws that create
operational outages. Management staff should be held
partly accountable for contribution to the technical
architecture and manageability design of applications.

■ A single Change Management process for both

groups, with Change Control in each group being
subordinate to the overall authority of Change
Management (see Service Transition publication).

■ A clear mapping of Development and Management

activities in the lifecycle, which is illustrated at a high
level in Figure 6.5. The exact activities and how they
interact should be defined in each organization,
although some generic guidelines are given in each 
of the ITIL publications.

■ Greater focus on integrating functionality and

manageability requirements early in the project.

Figure 6.6 shows a common Application Management
Lifecycle with involvement from both groups. In this
diagram it is clear that Application Development will be
driving some phases with input from Application
Management. In other cases Application Management will
be driving the phase with input and support from
Application Development. Both groups are subordinated
to the IT Service Strategy of the organization and their
efforts are coordinated through Service Transition
mechanisms and processes.

6.5.7 Application Management roles and
responsibilities

6.5.7.1 Applications Managers/Team-leaders
An Applications Manager or Team-leader (depending upon
the size and/or importance of the team or department
and the application they support, and the organization’s
structure and culture) will be needed for each of the
applications teams or departments. The role will:

■ Take overall responsibility for leadership, control and

decision-making for the applications team or
department

■ Provide technical knowledge and leadership in the

specific applications support activities covered by the
team or department

■ Ensure necessary technical training, awareness and

experience levels are maintained within the team or
department relevant to the applications being
supported and processes being used

■ Involve ongoing communication with users and

customers regarding application performance and
evolving requirements of the business

■ Report to senior management on all issues relevant to

the applications being supported

Organizing for Service Operation  | 137

■ Perform line-management for all team or department

● Transaction rates and availability for critical

members.

6.5.7.2 Applications Analyst/Architect
Application Analysts and Architects are responsible for
matching requirements to application specifications.
Specific activities include:

■ Working with users, sponsors and all other

stakeholders to determine their evolving needs

■ Working with Technical Management to determine the
highest level of system requirements required to meet
the business requirements within budget and
technology constraints

■ Performing cost-benefit analyses to determine the

most appropriate means to meet the stated
requirement

■ Developing Operational Models that will ensure

optimal use of resources and the appropriate level 
of performance

■ Ensuring that applications are designed to be
effectively managed given the organization’s
technology architecture, available skills and tools

■ Developing and maintaining standards for application

sizing, performance modelling, etc

■ Generating a set of acceptance test requirements,

together with the designers, test engineers and the
user, which determine that all of the high-level
requirements have been met, both functional 
and with regard to manageability

■ Input into the design of configuration data required 

to manage and track the application effectively.

An appropriate number of Application Analysts will be
needed for each of the Application Management teams or
department to perform the generic activities described in
paragraph 6.5.5.

The ways in which Application Management groups can
be organized, and the options available, are discussed in
some detail in section 6.7 below.

6.5.8 Application Management metrics
Metrics for Application Management will largely depend
on which applications are being managed, but some
generic metrics include:

■ Measurement of agreed outputs. These could

include:
● Ability of users to access the application and its

functionality

● Reports and files are transmitted to the users

business transactions
● Service Desk training
● Recording problem resolutions into the KEDB
● User measures of the quality of outputs as defined

in the SLAs.

■ Process metrics. Technical Management teams

execute many Service Management process activities.
Their ability to do so will be measured as part of the
process metrics where appropriate (see section on
each process for more details). Examples include:
● Response time to events and event completion

rates

● Incident resolution times for second- and third-line

support

● Problem resolution statistics
● Number of escalations and reason for those

escalations

● Number of changes implemented and backed out
● Number of unauthorized changes detected
● Number of releases deployed, total and successful,

including ensuring adherence to the Release
Policies of the organization

● Security issues detected and resolved
● Actual system utilization against Capacity Plan

forecasts (where the team has contributed to the
development of the plan)

● Tracking against SIPs
● Expenditure against budget.

■ Application performance. These metrics are based

on Service Design specifications and technical
performance standards set by vendors and will
typically be contained in OLAs or SOPs. Actual metrics
will vary by application, but are likely to include:
● Response times
● Application availability, which is helpful for

measuring team or application performance but is
not to be confused with Service Availability –
which requires the ability to measure the overall
availability of the service, and may use the
availability figures for a number of individual
systems or components

● Integrity of data and reporting.

■ Measurement of maintenance activity, including:

● Maintenance performed per schedule
● Number of maintenance windows exceeded
● Maintenance objectives achieved (number and

percentage).

138 | Organizing for Service Operation

■ Application Management teams are likely to work

closely with Application Development teams on
projects, and appropriate metrics should be used to
measure this, including:
● Time spent on projects
● Customer and user satisfaction with the output of

the project

● Cost of involvement in the project.

■ Training and skills development. These metrics

ensure that staff have the skills and training to
manage the technology that is under their control,
and will also identify areas where training is 
still required.

6.5.9 Application Management
documentation
A number of documents are produced and used during
Application Management. This list is a summary of some
of the most important and does not include reports or
documents that are produced by Application Management
on behalf of other process or functions (e.g. RFC, Known
Error documentation, Release Records, etc.). Note that
documents should be controlled as CIs and related to the
relevant applications or Application Management teams.

6.5.9.1 Application Portfolio
The Application Portfolio is used primarily as part of
Service Strategy, but is referenced here for completeness.
The Application Portfolio is a list (more accurately a system
or database) of all applications in use within the
organization, together with the following information:

Key attributes of the application

■ Customers and users
■ Business purpose
■ Level of business criticality
■ Architecture (including the IT Infrastructure

dependencies)

■ Developers, support groups, suppliers or vendors
■ The investment made in the application to date. In
this respect the Application Portfolio can be used as
an asset register for applications,

The purpose of the Application Portfolio is to analyse the
need for and use of applications in the organization. It can
be used to link functionality and investment to business
activity and is therefore an important part of ongoing IT
planning and control. Another benefit of the Application
Portfolio is that it can be used to identify duplication and
excessive licensing of applications.

The Application Portfolio forms part of the overall IT
Service Portfolio, which is discussed in detail in the Service
Strategy publication.

The Application Portfolio and the Service
Catalogue

The Application Portfolio should not be mistaken for
the Service Catalogue and should not be advertised
as a list of services to customers or users. Applications
are one of the components used to provide IT
services, usually not the service itself.

The Application Portfolio should therefore be used as
a planning document only by those managers and
staff who are involved with the development and
management of the organization’s IT Strategy, as well
as IT staff who are tasked with managing the
applications or the platforms on which the
applications run.

The Service Catalogue should focus on listing the
services that are available, rather than simply listing
applications and assuming that users and customers
can make the link. Having said that, there are times
when the application is synonymous with the service,
e.g. word-processing applications are typically known
by their name; an application hosting service will
mention the names of the application hosted, etc.

6.5.9.2 Application Requirements
There are two sets of documents containing requirements
for applications:

■ Business Requirements outline the Business Case for

the required application, in other words what the
business will do with the application. This will include
the Return on Investment for the application as well as
all related improvements to the business. Business
requirements will also include the Service Level
Requirements as defined by the service customers and
users.

■ Application Requirements documents are based on

the Business Requirements and specify exactly how
the application will meet those requirements. In short,
Application Requirements documents gather
information that will be used to commission new
applications or changes to existing applications, for
example:
● To design the architecture of the application

(specification of the different components of the
system, how they relate to one another and how
they will be managed)

Organizing for Service Operation  | 139

● To specify a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a
Commercial, Off the Shelf (COTS) application

facilitating communication between users, Developers
and Application Management staff.

● To initiate the design and building of an

■ Change Cases use scenarios to predict the impact of

application in-house.

Requirements documents are normally owned by a project
leader, either of a development project team, or for a
team drawing up specifications for an RFP. Requirements
documents are subject to document control for the
project as they form part of the overall scope of the
project.

Four different types of Application Requirements need to
be defined (for more detailed information, please refer to
the ITIL Service Design and Service Transition publications):

■ Functional Requirements describe the things an

application is intended to do, and can be expressed as
services, tasks or functions the application is required
to perform.

■ Manageability Requirements are used to define

what is needed to manage the application or to
ensure that it performs the required functions
consistently and at the right level. Manageability
requirements also identify constraints on the IT system.
These requirements serve as a basis for early system
sizing and estimates of cost, and can support the
assessment of the viability of the proposed IT system.
Most importantly, they drive design of the operational
models and performance standards used in IT
Operations Management.

■ Usability Requirements are normally specified by the

users of the application and refer to its ease of use.
Any special requirements for handicapped users also
need to be specified here.

■ Test Requirements specify what is required to ensure

that the test environment is representative of the
operational environment and that the test is valid (i.e.
that it actually tests what it is supposed to).

6.5.9.3 Use and Change Cases
Use and Change Cases are managed as part of the Service
Design and Continual Service Improvement processes, but
are maintained by Application Management. For
purchased software, it is common for the team that
develops the functional specifications to maintain the Use
Case for that application.

■ Use Cases document the intended use of the

application with real-life scenarios to demonstrate its
boundaries and its full functionality. Use Cases can
also be used as modelling and sizing scenarios and for

potential changes to utilization, architecture or
functionality, and project the impact of specific
change scenarios. Change Cases are used to clarify
scope and direction with the sponsor. Extra
architecture and design work will be needed at this
point to ensure the Change Cases can be met in the
future at reasonable cost. The sponsor must be
prepared to pay the extra cost. If not, the Change
Cases should be reduced to what the sponsor is
prepared to pay for. Change Cases are also used to
evaluate the architecture. They influence the
development process enabling the design of
appropriate architectural features to minimize the
impact of future changes.

For more information, refer to the ITIL Service Design and
Continual Service Improvement publications.

6.5.9.4 Design documentation
This is not one specific document, but refers to any
document produced by Application Development or
Management staff that specifies how an application will be
built. As these documents are generally owned and
managed by the Development teams, this publication will
not cover them in detail. However, to ensure successful
operation, Application Management must ensure that
design documentation contains:

■ Sizing specifications
■ Workload profiles and utilization forecasts
■ Technical Architecture
■ Data models
■ Coding standards
■ Performance standards
■ Software Configuration Management definitions
■ Environment definitions and building considerations (if

appropriate).

For COTS applications, these documents take the form of
Application Specifications that are used as input into the
writing of RFPs. In these cases the documents are owned
and managed by Application Management.

For more information on Design Documentation, refer to
the ITIL Service Design publication.

6.5.9.5 Manuals
Application Management is responsible for the
management of manuals for all applications. Although
these are normally developed by the Application

140 | Organizing for Service Operation

Development teams or third party suppliers, Application
Management is responsible for ensuring that the manuals
are relevant to the operational versions of the applications.

individual or shared between two or more, the importance
is the consistency of accountability and execution, along
with the interaction with other roles in the organization.

Three types of manuals are generally maintained by
Application Management:

■ Design manuals contain information about the

structure and architecture of the application. These are
helpful for creating reports or defining event
correlation rules. They could also help in diagnosing
problems.

■ Administration or management manuals describe

the activities required to maintain and operate the
application at the levels of performance specified in
the Design phase. These manuals will also provide
detailed troubleshooting, Known Error and Fault
descriptions, and step-by-step instructions for common
maintenance tasks.

■ User manuals describe the application functionality as
it is used by an end-user. These manuals contain step-
by-step instructions on how to use the application, as
well as descriptions of what should typically be
entered into certain fields, or what to do if there is an
error.

Manuals and Standard Operating Procedures

Manuals should not be seen as a replacement for
SOPs, but as input into the SOPs.

SOPs should contain all aspects of applications that
need to be managed as part of standard operations.
If they are not extracted from the manuals, there is a
high likelihood that they will be ignored or
performed in a non-standard manner. Application
Management should ensure that any such
instructions are extracted from the manuals and
inserted into separate SOP documentation for
Operations. It is also responsible for ensuring that
these instructions are updated with every change or
new release of the software.

6.6 SERVICE OPERATION ROLES AND
RESPONSIBILITIES

The key to effective ITSM is ensuring that there is clear
accountability and roles defined to carry out the practice
of Service Operation. A role is often tied to a job
description or work group description but does not
necessarily need to be filled by one individual. The size of
an organization, how it is structured, the existence of
external partners and other factors will influence how roles
are assigned. Whether a particular role is filled by a single

6.6.1 Service Desk roles
The following roles are needed for the Service Desk.

6.6.1.1 Service Desk Manager
In larger organizations where the Service Desk is of a
significant size, a Service Desk Manager role may be
justified with the Service Desk Supervisor(s) reporting to
him or her. In such cases this role may take responsibility
for some of the activities listed above and may
additionally perform the following activities:

■ Manage the overall desk activities, including the

supervisors

■ Act as a further escalation point for the supervisor(s)
■ Take on a wider customer-services role
■ Report to senior managers on any issue that could

significantly impact the business

■ Attend Change Advisory Board meetings
■ Take overall responsibility for incident and Service

Request handling on the Service Desk. This could also
be expanded to any other activity taken on by the
Service Desk – e.g. monitoring certain classes of event.

Note: In all cases, clearly defined job descriptions should
be drafted and agreed so that specific responsibilities are
known.

6.6.1.2 Service Desk Supervisor
In very small desks it is possible that the senior Service
Desk Analyst will also act as the Supervisor – but in larger
desks it is likely that a dedicated Service Desk Supervisor
role will be needed. Where shift hours dictate it, there may
be two or more post-holders who fulfil the role, usually on
an overlapping basis. The Supervisor’s role is likely to
include:

■ Ensuring that staffing and skill levels are maintained

throughout operational hours by managing shift
staffing schedules, etc.

■ Undertaking HR activities as needed
■ Acting as an escalation point where difficult or

controversial calls are received

■ Production of statistics and management reports
■ Representing the Service Desk at meetings
■ Arranging staff training and awareness sessions
■ Liaising with senior management
■ Liaising with Change Management

Organizing for Service Operation  | 141

■ Performing briefings to Service Desk staff on changes

■ Perform line-management for all team or department

or deployments that may affect volumes at the Service
Desk

members.

■ Assisting analysts in providing first-line support when
workloads are high, or where additional experience is
required.

6.6.1.3 Service Desk Analysts
The primary Service Desk Analyst role is that of providing
first-level support through taking calls and handling the
resulting incidents or Service Requests using the Incident
Reporting and Request Fulfilment processes, in line with
the objectives described earlier. The exact number of staff
required is discussed in paragraph 6.2.4.1.

6.6.1.4 Super Users
Super Users are discussed in detail in the section on
Service Desk staffing in paragraph 6.2.4. In summary, this
role will consist of business users who act as liaison points
with IT in general and the Service Desk in particular. The
role of the Super User can be summarized as follows:

■ To facilitate communication between IT and the

business at an operational level

■ To reinforce expectations of users regarding what

Service Levels have been agreed

■ Staff training for users in their area
■ Providing support for minor incidents or simple

request fulfilment

■ Involvement with new releases and rollouts.

6.6.2 Technical Management roles
The following roles are needed in the Technical
Management areas

6.6.2.1 Technical Managers/Team-leaders
A Technical Manager or Team-leader (depending upon the
size and/or importance of the team and the organization’s
structure and culture) may be needed for each of the
technical teams or departments. The role will:

■ Take overall responsibility for leadership, control and

decision-making for the technical team or department

■ Provide technical knowledge and leadership in the

specific technical areas covered by the team or
department

■ Ensure necessary technical training, awareness and

experience levels are maintained within the team or
department

■ Report to senior management on all technical issues

relevant to their area of responsibility

6.6.2.2 Technical Analysts/Architects
This term refers to any staff member in Technical
Management who performs the activities listed in
paragraph 6.3.3, excluding the daily operational actions,
which are performed by Operators in either Technical or IT
Operations Management. Based on the list of generic
activities in paragraph 6.3.3, the role of Technical Analysts
and Architects includes:

■ Working with users, sponsors, Application

Management and all other stakeholders to determine
their evolving needs

■ Working with Application Management and other
areas in Technical Management to determine the
highest level of system requirements required to meet
the requirements within budget and technology
constraints

■ Defining and maintaining knowledge about how

systems are related and ensuring that dependencies
are understood and managed accordingly

■ Performing cost-benefit analyses to determine the

most appropriate means to meet the stated
requirements

■ Developing Operational Models that will ensure

optimal use of resources and the appropriate level 
of performance

■ Ensuring that the infrastructure is configured to be

effectively managed given the organization’s
technology architecture, available skills and tools
■ Ensuring the consistent and reliable performance 
of the infrastructure to deliver the required level 
of service to the business

■ Defining all tasks required to manage the

infrastructure and ensuring that these tasks are
performed appropriately

■ Input into the design of configuration data required 

to manage and track the application effectively.

The ways in which Technical Management can be
organized, and the options available, are discussed in
some detail in section 6.7.

6.6.2.3 Technical Operator
This term is used to refer to any staff who performs day-
to-day operational tasks in Technical Management. Usually,
these tasks are delegated to a dedicated IT Operations
team, and this role is therefore discussed in paragraph
6.6.3.4 on IT Operators.

142 | Organizing for Service Operation

6.6.3 IT Operations Management roles
The following roles and needed in the IT Operations
Management area:

6.6.3.1 IT Operations Manager
An IT Operations Manager will be needed to take overall
responsibility for all of the IT Operations Management
activities, which include:

■ Operations Control, which oversees the execution

and monitoring of the operational activities in the IT
Infrastructure. This can be done with the assistance of
an Operations Bridge or Network Operations Centre. In
addition to executing routine tasks from all technical
areas, Operations Control also performs the following
specific tasks:
● Console Management, which refers to defining

central observation and monitoring capability and
then using those consoles to exercise monitoring
and control activities

● Job Scheduling, or the management of routine

batch jobs or scripts

● Backup and Restore on behalf of all Technical

and Application Management teams or department
and often on behalf of users

● Print and Output management for the collation

and distribution of all centralized printing or
electronic output.

■ Facilities Management, which refers to the

management of the physical IT environment, typically
a Data Centre or computer rooms and recovery sites
together with all the power and cooling equipment.
Facilities Management also includes the coordination
of large-scale consolidation projects, e.g. data centre
consolidation or server consolidation projects. In some
cases the management of a Data Centre is outsourced,
in which case Facilities Management refers to the
management of the outsourcing contract.

The role of the IT Operations Manager is to:

leader will be needed on each of the shifts, to perform the
following activities:

■ Take overall responsibility for leadership, control and

decision-making during the shift period

■ Ensure that all operational activities are satisfactorily

performed within agreed timescales and in accordance
with company policies and procedures

■ Liaise with the other shift leader(s) to ensure

handover, continuity and consistency between the
shifts

■ Act as line-manager for all Operations Analysts on

his/her shift

■ Assume overall health and safety, and security

responsibility for the shift (unless specifically
designated to other staff members).

6.6.3.3 IT Operations Analysts
IT Operations Analysts are senior IT Operations staff who
are able to determine the most effective and efficient way
to conduct a series of operations, usually in high-volume,
diverse environments.

This role is normally performed as part of Technical
Management, but large organizations may find that the
volume and diversity of operational activities requires
some more in-depth planning and execution. Examples
include Job Scheduling and the definition of a Backup
strategy and schedule.

6.6.3.4 IT Operators
IT Operators are the staff who perform the day-to-day
operational activities that are defined in Technical or
Application Management and, in some cases, IT
Operations Analysts. Typical Operator roles include:

■ Performing backups
■ Console operations, i.e. monitoring the status of

specific systems, job queues, etc. and providing first-
level intervention if appropriate

■ Managing print devices, restocking with paper, 

■ Provide overall leadership, control and decision-

6.6.4 Application Management roles

6.6.4.1 Applications Managers/Team-leaders
An Applications Manager or Team-leader should be
considered for each of the applications teams or
departments. The role will:

■ Take overall responsibility for leadership, control and

decision-making for the applications team or
department

■ Provide technical knowledge and leadership in the

specific applications support activities covered by the
team or department

■ Ensure necessary technical training, awareness and

experience levels are maintained within the team or
department relevant to the applications being
supported and processes being used

■ Involve ongoing communication with users and

customers regarding application performance and
evolving requirements of the business

■ Report to senior management on all issues relevant to

the applications being supported

■ Perform line-management for all team or department

members.

6.6.4.2 Applications Analyst/Architect
Application Analysts and Architects are responsible for
matching requirements to application specifications.
Specific activities include:

■ Working with users, sponsors and all other

stakeholders to determine their evolving needs

■ Working with Technical Management to determine the
highest level of system requirements required to meet
the requirements within budget and technology
constraints

■ Performing cost-benefit analyses to determine the

most appropriate means to meet the stated
requirement

■ Developing Operational Models that will ensure

optimal use of resources and the appropriate level 
of performance

■ Ensuring that applications are designed to be
effectively managed given the organization’s
technology architecture, available skills and tools

■ Developing and maintaining standards for application

sizing, performance modelling, etc.

■ Generating a set of acceptance test requirements,

together with the designers, test engineers and the
user, which determine that all of the high-level

requirements have been met, both functional and with
regard to manageability

■ Input into the design of configuration data required to

manage and track the application effectively.

An appropriate number of Application Analysts will be
needed for each of the Application Management teams or
department to perform the activities described elsewhere
in this publication, primarily in paragraph 6.5.5.

The ways in which Application Management groups can
be organized, and the options available, are discussed in
some detail in section 6.7.

6.6.5 Event Management roles
It is unusual for an organization to appoint an ‘Event
Manager’, as events tend to occur in multiple contexts and
for many different reasons. However, it is important that
Event Management procedures are coordinated to prevent
duplication of effort and tools. The roles of the Service
Operation functions in Event Management are as follows.

6.6.5.1 The role of the Service Desk
The Service Desk is not typically involved in Event
Management as such, unless an event requires some
response that is within the scope of the Service Desk’s
defined activity, for example notifying a user that a report
is ready. Generally, though, this type of activity is
performed by the Operations Bridge, unless the Service
Desk and Operations Bridge have been combined.

The investigation and resolution of events that have been
identified as being Incidents will initially be undertaken by
the Service Desk and then escalated to the appropriate
Service Operation team(s)

The Service Desk is also responsible for communicating
information about this type of incident to the relevant
Technical or Application Management team and, where
appropriate, the user.

6.6.5.2 The role of Technical and Application
Management
Technical and Application Management plays several
important roles as follows:

■ During Service Design, they will participate in the

instrumentation of the service, classify events, update
correlation engines and ensure that any auto
responses are defined

■ During Service Transition they will test the service to

ensure that events are properly generated and that
the defined responses are appropriate

144 | Organizing for Service Operation

■ During Service Operation these teams will typically

■ Developing and maintaining the Incident Management

perform Event Management for the systems under
their control. It is unusual for teams to have a
dedicated person to manage Event Management, but
each manager or team leader will ensure that the
appropriate procedures are defined and executed
according to the process and policy requirements

■ Technical and Application Management will also be

involved in dealing with incidents and problems
related to events

■ If Event Management activities are delegated to the
Service Desk or IT Operations Management, Technical
and Application Management must ensure that the
staff are adequately trained and that they have access
to the appropriate tools to enable them to perform
these tasks.

6.6.5.3 The role of IT Operations Management
Where IT Operations is separated from Technical or
Application Management, it is common for Event
Monitoring and first-line response to be delegated to IT
Operations Management. Operators for each area will be
tasked with monitoring events, responding as required, or
ensuring that Incidents are created as appropriate. The
instructions for how to do so must be included in the
SOPs for those teams.

Event Monitoring is commonly delegated to the
Operations Bridge where it exists. The Operations Bridge
can initiate and coordinate, or even perform, the
responses required by the service, or provide first-level
support for those events which generate an incident.

6.6.6 Incident Management roles
The following roles are needed for the Incident
Management process.

6.6.6.1 Incident Manager
An Incident Manager has the responsibility for:

■ Driving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Incident

Management process

■ Producing management information
■ Managing the work of incident support staff (first- and

second-line)

■ Monitoring the effectiveness of Incident Management

and making recommendations for improvement

■ Developing and maintaining the Incident Management

systems

■ Managing Major Incidents

process and procedures.

In many organizations the role of Incident Manager is
assigned to the Service Desk Supervisor – though in larger
organizations with high volumes a separate role may be
necessary. In either case it is important that the Incident
Manager is given the authority to manage incidents
effectively through first, second and third line.

6.6.6.2 First line
This is covered in detail under the Service Desk (section
6.1) and will not be repeated here.

6.6.6.3 Second line
Many organizations will choose to have a second-line
support group, made up of staff with greater (though still
general) technical skills than the Service Desk – and with
additional time to devote to incident diagnosis and
resolution without interference from telephone
interruptions.

Such a group can handle many of the less complicated
incidents, leaving more specialist (third-line) support
groups to concentrate on dealing with more deep-rooted
incidents and/or new developments etc.

Where a second-line group is used, there are often
advantages of locating this group close to the Service
Desk to aid with good communications and to ease
movement of staff between the groups, which may be
helpful for training/awareness and during busy periods 
or staff shortages. A second-line support manager (or
supervisor if just a small group) will normally head 
this group.

It is conceivable that this group may be outsourced – and
this is more likely and practical if the Service Desk itself
has been outsourced.

6.6.6.4 Third line
Third-line support will be provided by a number of
internal technical groups and/or third-party
suppliers/maintainers. The list will vary from organization
to organization but is likely to include:

■ Network Support
■ Voice Support (if separate)
■ Server Support
■ Desktop Support
■ Application Management – likely that there may be

separate teams for different applications or application
types – some of which may be external

Organizing for Service Operation  | 145

supplier/maintainers. In many cases the same team
will be responsible for Application Developments as
well as support – and it is therefore important that
resources are prioritized so that support is given
adequate prominence

■ Database Support
■ Hardware Maintenance Engineers
■ Environmental Equipment Maintainers/Suppliers.

Note: Depending upon where an organization decides to
source its support services, any of the above groups could
be internal or external groups.

6.6.7 Request Fulfilment roles
Initial handling of Service Requests will be undertaken by
the Service Desk and Incident Management staff.

Eventual fulfilment of the request will be undertaken by
the appropriate Service Operation team(s) or departments
and/or by external suppliers, as appropriate. Often,
Facilities Management, Procurement and other business
areas aid in the fulfilment of the Service Request. In most
cases there will be no need for additional roles or posts to
be created.

In exceptional cases where a very high number of Service
Requests are handled, or where the requests are of critical
importance to the organization, it may be appropriate to
have one or more of the Incident Management team
dedicated to handling and managing Service Requests.

6.6.8 Problem Management roles
The following roles are needed for the Problem
Management process.

6.6.8.1 Problem Manager
There should be a designated person (or, in larger
organizations, a team) responsible for Problem
Management. Smaller organizations may not be able to
justify a full-time resource for this role, and it can be
combined with other roles in such cases, but it is essential
that it not just left to technical resources to perform. There
needs to be a single point of coordination and an owner
of the Problem Management process. This role will
coordinate all Problem Management activities and will
have specific responsibility for:

■ Liaison with all problem resolution groups to ensure

swift resolution of problems within SLA targets

■ Ownership and protection of the KEDB
■ Gatekeeper for the inclusion of all Known Errors and

management of search algorithms

■ Formal closure of all Problem Records

■ Liaison with suppliers, contractors, etc. to ensure that

third parties fulfil their contractual obligations,
especially with regard to resolving problems and
providing problem-related information and data

■ Arranging, running, documenting and all follow-up

activities relating to Major Problem Reviews.

6.6.8.2 Problem-Solving Groups
The actual solving of problems is likely to be undertaken
by one or more technical support groups and/or suppliers
or support contractors – under the coordination of the
Problem Manager.

Where an individual problem is serious enough to warrant
it, a dedicated problem management team should be
formulated to work together in overcoming that particular
problem. The Problem Manager has a role to play in
making sure that the correct number and level of
resources is available in the team and for escalation and
communication up the management chain of all
organizations concerned.

6.6.9 Access Management roles
Since Access Management is an execution of Security and
Availability Management, these two areas will be
responsible for defining the appropriate roles. It is unusual
for an organization to appoint an ‘Access Manager’,
although it is important that there is a single Access
Management process and a single set of policies related to
managing rights and access. This process and the related
policies are likely to be defined and maintained by
Information Security Management and executed by the
various Service Operation functions. Their activities can be
summarized as follows.

6.6.9.1 The role of the Service Desk
The Service Desk is typically used as a means to request
access to a service. This is normally done using a Service
Request. The Service Desk will validate the request by
checking that the request has been approved at the
appropriate level of authority, that the user is a legitimate
employee, contractor or customer and that they qualify for
access.

Once it has performed these checks (usually by accessing
the relevant databases and Service Level Management
documents) it will pass the request to the appropriate
team to provide access. It is quite common for the Service
Desk to be delegated responsibility for providing access
for simple services during the call.

The Service Desk will also be responsible for
communicating with the user to ensure that they know

146 | Organizing for Service Operation

when access has been granted and to ensure that they
receive any other required support.

The Service Desk is also well situated to detect and report
incidents related to access. For example, users attempting
to access services without authority; or users reporting
incidents that indicate that a system or service has been
used inappropriately, i.e. by a former employee who 
used an old username to gain access and make
unauthorized changes.

6.6.9.2 The role of Technical and Application
Management
Technical and Application Management play several
important roles as follows:

■ During Service Design, they will ensure that

mechanisms are created to simplify and control Access
Management on each service that is designed. They
will also specify ways in which abuse of rights can be
detected and stopped

■ During Service Transition they will test the service to

ensure that access can be granted, controlled and
prevented as designed

■ During Service Operation these teams will typically
perform Access Management for the systems under
their control. It is unusual for teams to have a
dedicated person to manage Access Management, but
each manager or team leader will ensure that the
appropriate procedures are defined and executed
according to the process and policy requirements

■ Technical and Application Management will also be

involved in dealing with Incidents and Problems
related to Access Management

■ If Access Management activities are delegated to the
Service Desk or IT Operations Management, Technical
and Application Management must ensure that the
staff are adequately trained and that they have access
to the appropriate tools to enable them to perform
these tasks.

6.6.9.3 The role of IT Operations Management
Where IT Operations is separated from Technical or
Application Management, it is common for operational
Access Management tasks to be delegated to IT
Operations Management. Operators for each area will be
tasked with providing or revoking access to key systems or
resources. The circumstances under which they may do so,
and the instructions for how to do so, must be included in
the SOPs for those teams.

The Operations Bridge, if it exists, can be used to monitor
events related to Access Management and can even
provide first-line support and coordination in the
resolution of those events where appropriate.

6.7 SERVICE OPERATION ORGANIZATION
STRUCTURES

Some general information has already been provided
about organizational considerations for each function (see
paragraphs 6.2.3, 6.3.4 and 6.5.6.). This section considers
some specific organizational structures for all functions.
There are a number of ways of organizing Service
Operation functions, and each organization will have to
make it own decisions, based upon its scale, geography,
culture and business environment. Some options are
discussed in the rest of this section.

6.7.1 Organization by technical
specialization
In this type of organization, departments are created
according to technology and the skills and activities
needed to manage that technology. IT Operations will
follow the structure of the Technical and Application
Management departments. The implication of this is that
IT Operations is geared toward the operational agendas of
the Technical and Application Management departments.

This structure can work well, provided that these 
groups are fully represented in the Service Design, 
Testing and Improvement processes, which will ensure
that their agendas are aligned with the requirements 
of the business.

This structure also assumes that all Technical and
Application Management departments have clearly
distinguished between their Management activity and
operations activity. It also requires that they have
standardized these operational activities so that they can
be effectively managed by the IT Operations Manager
without undue interference from the Technical and
Application Management teams or departments.

An example of an IT Operations organization structure
based on technical expertise is given in Figure 6.7

The advantages of this type of organizational structure
include:

■ It is easier to set internal performance objectives since

all staff in a single department have a similar set of
tasks on a similar technology

Organizing for Service Operation  | 147

■ Individual devices, systems or platforms can be
managed more effectively since people with the
appropriate skills are dedicated to manage these and
measured according to their performance

■ Managing training programmes is easier since skill sets
are clearly defined and separated into specific groups.

The disadvantages of this type of organizational structure
include the following:

■ When people are divided into separate departments
the priorities of their own group tend to override the
priorities of other departments. An example of this is
when departments refuse to accept ownership of an
incident, each one blaming the other while the
business continues to be disrupted.

148 | Organizing for Service Operation

■ Knowledge about the infrastructure and relationships

■ Maintenance (this implies that one team will

between components is difficult to collect and
fragmented. Individual groups tend to collect and
maintain only the data that is required to support
their own function, and do not give access to it 
very easily.

■ Each technology managed by a group is seen as a

separate entity. This becomes a problem on systems
that consist of components managed by different
teams, e.g. an application, managed by the
Application Management team, runs on a server
managed by the Server Management department,
using a network segment managed by the Local Area
Networking department. If a change is made by one
team or department without consulting the others,
this could be disastrous for the service.

■ It is more difficult to understand the impact of a
single department’s poor performance on the IT
Service since there are many different groups
contributing to the same service, each with its own set
of performance objectives.

■ It is more difficult to track overall IT Service

performance since each group is being measured on
an individual basis.

■ Coordinating Change Assessments and Schedules is

coordinate and perform all maintenance across 
all technologies)

■ Contract Management or Third Party Management
■ Monitoring and Control
■ Operations Bridge
■ Network Operations Centre
■ Operations Strategy and Planning (which, as part of
the Service Design processes, normally defines the
standards to be used in IT Operations) – this
department can set strategy or standards for every
type of Technical and Application Management area.

The Operations Strategy and Planning department is used
to illustrate this type of structure in Figure 6.8.

The advantages of this type of organizational structure
include the following:

■ It is easier to manage groups of related activities since
all the people involved in these activities report to the
same manager

■ Measurement of teams or departments is based more

on output than on isolated activities. This helps to
build higher levels of assurance that a service can 
be delivered.

more difficult since many different departments have
to provide input for each change.

The disadvantages of this type of organizational structure
include the following:

■ Work requiring knowledge of multiple technologies is
difficult since most resources are only trained for and
concerned with the management of a single
technology. Projects therefore have to include cross-
training, which is time-consuming and expensive.

6.7.2 Organization by activity
This type of organization structure focuses on the fact that
similar activities have to be performed on all technologies
in the organization. This means that people who perform
similar activities, regardless of the technology, should be
grouped together, although within each department there
may be teams focusing on a specific technology,
application, etc.

In this type of organization, there is no clear differentiation
between the different Technical and Application
Management areas. Similar activities from many different
areas can be grouped into a single department.

Examples of departments that have been set up to
perform a specific set of activities across multiple
technologies include:

■ Resources with similar skills may be duplicated across

different functions, which results in higher costs

■ Although measurement is more output-based, it is 

still focused on the performance of internal activities
rather than driven by the experience of the customer
or end user.

6.7.3 Organizing to manage processes
It is not a good idea to structure the whole organization
according to processes. Processes are used to overcome
the ‘silo effect’ of departments, not to create silos.
However, there are a number of processes that will need a
dedicated organization structure to support and manage
it. For example, it will be very difficult for Financial
Management to be successful without a dedicated Finance
department – even if that department consists of a small
number of staff.

In process-based organizations people are organized into
groups or departments that perform or manage a specific
process. This is similar to the activity-based structure,
except that its departments focus on end-to-end sets of
activities rather than on one individual type of activity.

Figure 6.8 A department based on executing a set of activities

It should be noted that this type of organization structure
should only be used if IT Operations Management is
responsible for more than just IT Operations. In some
organizations, for example, IT Operations is responsible for
defining SLAs and negotiating UCs.

In addition, processes specifically exist to link the activities
of different groups to achieve a specific outcome. Using
processes as the basis to create departments can defeat
the purpose of having processes in the first place. Process-
based departments are really only effective when they are
able to coordinate the execution of the process through
the entire organization.

This means that process-based departments should only
be considered if IT Operations Management is to play the
role of Process Owner for a specific process.

Examples of process-based groups or departments include:

■ Capacity Operations
■ Availability Monitoring and Control
■ IT Financial Management
■ Security Administration
■ Asset and Configuration Management (including

equipment installation and deployment).

The advantages of this type of organizational structure
include the following:

■ Processes are easier to define
■ There is less role conflict as job descriptions and
process role descriptions are the same. In other
structures a single job description will typically include
activities for several roles

150 | Organizing for Service Operation

■ Metrics of team or department performance and

process performance are the same, effectively aligning
‘internal’ and ‘external’ metrics.

The disadvantages of this type of organizational structure
include the following:

■ A basic principle of processes is that they are a means

of linking the activities of various departments and
groups. By using processes as a basis for
organizational design, additional processes need to be
defined to ensure that the departments work together.

■ Even if a department is responsible for executing a

process, there will still be external dependencies.
Groups may not view process activities outside of their
own process as being important, resulting in processes
that cannot be fully executed because dependencies
cannot be met.

■ While some aspects of a process can be centralized,
there will always be a number of activities that will
have to be performed by other groups. The
relationship between the dedicated team or
department and the people performing the
decentralized activities is often difficult to define and
manage.

6.7.4 Organizing IT Operations by
geography
IT Operations can be physically distributed and in some
cases each location needs to be organized according to its
own particular context.

This structure is typically used in the following
circumstances:

■ Data Centres are geographically distributed
■ Different regions or countries have different

technologies or provide a different set of services

■ There are different business models or organizational
structures in the different regions, i.e. the business is
decentralized by geography and each Business Unit is
fairly autonomous

■ Different legislation applies to different countries 

or regions (e.g. safety regulations)

■ Different standards apply to different countries 

or regions

■ Cultural or language differences exist between staff

managing IT.

An example of this type of structure is given in Figure 6.9.
Note that in this example each geographical department is
structured internally using Technical Specialization. This
could be different in each region. For example one region

may be structured in this way, while another region uses a
process- or activity-based structure.

Figure 6.9 also illustrates that one location could perform
centralized operations for all regions if they are similar
enough. In this example, the American Server Operations
Department manages all server operations in all locations,
Brussels manages all database operations and Singapore
manages all storage operations.

The advantages of this type of organizational structure
include the following:

■ Organization structure can be customized to meet

local conditions

■ IT Operations can be customized to meet differing

levels of IT service from region to region.

The disadvantages of this type of organizational structure
include the following:

■ Reporting lines and authority structures can be

confusing. For example, does Network Operations
report into the local Data Centre Manager or to a
centralized Network Operations Manager?

■ Operational standards are difficult to impose, resulting

in inconsistent and duplicated activities and tools,
resulting in reduced economies of scale, which in turn
increases the overall cost of operations.

■ Duplication of roles, activities, tools and facilities

across multiple locations could be very costly.

■ Shared services, such as e-mail, are more difficult to

deliver as each regional organization operates
differently.

■ Communication with customers and inside IT will be

more difficult as they are not co-located and it may be
difficult for staff in one location to understand the
priorities of customers or staff in another location.

6.7.5 Hybrid organization structures
It is unlikely that IT Operations Management will be
structured using only one type of organization structure.
Most organizations use a technical specialization, with
some additional activity- or process-based departments.

The type of structure used and the exact combination of
technical specialization, activity-based and process-based
departments will depend on a number of organizational
variables.

Figure 6.10 Centralized IT Operations, Technical and Application Management structure

6.7.5.1 Combined functions
One last type of organization should be discussed. This
structure incorporates IT Operations, Technical and
Application Management departments into a single
structure. This is sometimes the case where all groups are
co-located in a single data centre. Here, the Data Centre
Manager takes responsibility for all Technical, Application
and IT Operations Management.

This type of organization structure is illustrated 
in Figure 6.10.

In this structure, IT Operations Management is responsible
for the Technical and Application Management functions,
which in turn are responsible for managing their own
operational activities. Each department is able to delegate
some of these activities to the Operations Control
department.

The advantages of this organization structure are:

■ There is greater consistency and control between the

more tactical and more operational Technical
Management activities

Organizing for Service Operation  | 153

■ It is easier to enforce the performance standards and

technical architectures that are created in Service
Design, since the people who were involved in design
are managing the activities of the people who are
executing those activities

■ As there is no duplication between location or activity,

this structure is often more cost-effective.

In Application Management, the central team could
participate in ongoing design and testing of the
application, monitoring and control; perform backups,
data integrity checks, etc. The local team could provide
on-site support and education to end users and work with
the local Technical Management team to resolve more
complex problems involving local equipment.

The disadvantage of this organization structure is:

■ The scope of this structure makes it very difficult to

manage effectively in large organizations or in
organizations with multiple Data Centres.

6.7.5.2 Organizing Application and Technical
Management
Technical and Application Management organizations tend
to be fairly straightforward. As stated in paragraphs 6.3.4
and 6.5.6, Technical Management departments are usually
based on the technology they manage and Application
Management departments on the applications and sets of
applications they manage.

However, there are some alternative organization
structures and variations, which are discussed in this
section.

6.7.5.3 Geography
In organizations with multiple locations, it is common for
the Technical and Application Management departments
to be represented in each physical location. However, this
does not mean that each location will have all the same
departments, or that they are all responsible for the same
actions.

As support and management tools mature more and more
IT Infrastructure and application CIs can be managed
remotely. This means that each department will have a
strong, centralized Technical or Application Management
team, with local members to provide specialized, on-site
activities or support.

For example, in Server Management, the central team will
help to create standards for server configuration, they will
monitor and control remote devices, perform backups,
perform Operating System upgrades, etc. The local teams
will provide basic on-site support, hardware maintenance
and repair and configuration and installation of new
servers.

There is one potential issue that needs to be resolved
however, and that is who the local team reports to. In
some organizations they report to the manager of the
centralized team. This has the added advantage of
consistent performance and management across the
whole enterprise.

In other organizations the local teams report to the most
senior IT Manager at that site. This has the added
advantage that IT Services can be customized to meet
local conditions, but it creates a lot of confusion about
who the local teams should take direction from.

The advantages of this type of organizational structure
include the following:

■ Organization structure can be customized to meet

local conditions

■ Technical and Application Management can be

customized to meet differing levels of IT service from
region to region.

The disadvantages of this type of organizational structure
include the following:

■ Reporting lines and authority structures can be

confusing

■ Standards are difficult to impose, resulting in

inconsistent and duplicated activities and tools,
resulting in reduced economies of scale, which in turn
increases the overall cost of operations

■ Duplication of roles, activities, tools and facilities

across multiple locations could be very costly.

6.7.5.4 Combined Technical and Application
Management structure
Some organizations organize their Technical and
Application Management functions according to systems.
This means that each department will consist of
application specialists and IT Infrastructure technical
specialists, all geared towards managing the services
based on that set of systems. Components that are shared
across all these systems, such as the network, will be
managed by dedicated Technical Management
departments.

154 | Organizing for Service Operation

The advantage of this organization structure is:

■ It is easier to produce high-quality output to the end
user because all department members are focused on
the success of the system as a whole, rather than the
performance of an individual technology component
or application.

The disadvantages of this organization structure are:

■ Duplication of skills and resources across several

departments will increase the cost of the organization.
For example, each group is likely to have an individual
or team dedicated to managing servers – each of
which will be doing very similar tasks. 

■ Communication between staff who are managing

similar technology is reduced. This reduces the
amount of learning by experience and increases
reliance on collaborative knowledge management
tools.

■ When people with similar skills are in the same

department, the department will compensate for
members with lower skill and competency levels.
When there is only one person with Server
Management skills on a system-based department,
and their competency is minimal, it will affect the
performance of the entire department.

7Technology

considerations

| 157

7 Technology considerations

Each function and process is defined in the relevant
section in Chapters 4 and 6. This chapter brings all
technology requirements together to define the overall
requirement of an integrated set of Service Management
technology for Service Operation.

The same technology, with some possible additions,
should be used for the other phases of ITSM – Service
Strategy, Service Design, Service Transition and Continual
Service Improvement – to give consistency and allow an
effective ITSM Lifecycle to be properly managed.

The main requirements for Service Operation are as set out
in this chapter.

7.1 GENERIC REQUIREMENTS

An integrated ITSM technology (or toolset, as some
suppliers sell their technology as ‘modules’ whereas some
organizations may choose to integrate products from
alternative suppliers) is needed that includes the following
core functionality.

7.1.1 Self-Help
Many organizations find it beneficial to offer ‘Self-Help’
capabilities to their users. The technology should therefore
support this capability with some form of web front-end
allowing web pages to be defined offering a menu-driven
range of Self-Help and Service Requests – with a direct
interface into the back-end process-handling software.

7.1.2 Workflow or process engine
A workflow or process control engine is needed to allow
the pre-definition and control of defined processes such as
an Incident Lifecycle, Request Fulfilment Lifecycle, Problem
Lifecycle, Change Model, etc.

This should allow responsibilities, activities, timescales,
escalation paths and alerting to be pre-defined and then
automatically managed.

7.1.3 Integrated CMS
The tool should have an integrated CMS to allow the
organization’s IT infrastructure assets, components,
services and any ancillary CIs (such as contracts, locations,
licences, suppliers etc. – anything that the IT organization
wishes to control) to be held, together with all relevant
attributes, in a centralised location – and to allow
relationships between each to be stored and maintained,

and linked to Incident, Problem, Known Error and Change
Records as appropriate.

7.1.4 Discovery/Deployment/Licensing
technology
In order to populate or verify the CMS data and to assist in
Licence Management, discovery or automated audit tools
will be required. Such tools should be capable of being
run from any location on the network and allow
interrogation and recovery of information relating to all
components that make up, or are connected to, the IT
Infrastructure.

Such technology should allow ‘filtering’ so that the data
being carried forward can be vetted and only required
data extracted. It is also very helpful if ‘changes only’ since
the last audit can be extracted and reported upon.

The same technology can often be used to deploy new
software to target locations – this is an essential
requirement for all Service Operation teams or
departments, to allow patches, transports etc. to be
distributed to the correct users.

An interface to ‘Self Help’ capabilities is desirable to allow
approved software downloads to be requested in this way
but automatically handled by the deployment software.

Tools that allow automatic comparison of software
licences’ details held (in the CMS, ideally) and actual
licence numbers deployed – with reporting of any
discrepancies – are extremely desirable.

7.1.5 Remote control
It is often helpful for the Service Desk Analysts and other
support groups to be able to take control of the user’s
desk-top (under properly controlled security conditions) so
as to allow them to conduct investigations or correct
settings, etc. Facilities to allow this level of remote control
will be needed.

7.1.6 Diagnostic utilities
It could be extremely useful for the Service Desk and other
support groups if the technology incorporated the
capability to create and use diagnostic scripts and other
diagnostic utilities (such as, for example, case-based
reasoning tools) to assist with earlier diagnosis of
incidents. Ideally, these should be ‘context sensitive’ and
presentation of the scripts automated so far as possible.

158 | Technology considerations

7.1.7 Reporting
There is no use in storing data unless it can be easily
retrieved and used to meet the organization’s purposes.
The technology should therefore incorporate good
reporting capabilities, as well as allow standard interfaces
which can be used to input data to industry-standard
reporting packages, dashboards, etc. Ideally, instant, on-
screen as well as printed reporting can be provided
through the use of context-sensitive ‘top ten’ reports.

7.1.8 Dashboards
Dashboard-type technology is useful to allow ‘see at a
glance’ visibility of overall IT service performance and
availability levels. Such displays can be included in
management-level reports to users and customers – but
can also give real-time information for inclusion in IT web
pages to give dynamic reporting, and can be used for
support and investigation purposes. Capabilities to support
customized views of information to meet specific levels of
interest can be particularly useful.

However, they sometimes represent a technical rather than
service view of the infrastructure and in such cases they
may be of less interest to customers and users.

7.1.9 Integration with Business Service
Management
There is a trend within the IT industry to try to bring
together business-related IT with the processes and
disciplines of IT Service Management – some call this
Business Service Management. To facilitate this, business
applications and tools need to be interfaced with ITSM
support tools to give the required functionality. This can
be illustrated by this example:

An Eastern European telecoms company was able to
interface its telephone cell-net monitoring and billing
system to its Event Management, Incident
Management and Configuration Management
processes. In this way it was able to detect any
unusual usage/billing patterns and interpret these
such that it could identify, with a high degree of
certainly, that a telephone had been stolen and was
being used to make illicit calls.

It was able to raise events for such patterns and
automate actions to suspend usage of the mobile
phone devices and, in parallel, identify the exact
location of the illicit user (using GPRS technology)
and raise incidents so that the police had the
capability of finding the suspected thief and
recovering the device.

More advanced tools integration capabilities are needed to
allow greater exploitation of this sort of business and IT
integration.

7.2 EVENT MANAGEMENT

The following features are desirable for any Event
Management technology:

■ Multi-environmental, open interface to allow

monitoring and alerting across heterogeneous services
and an organization’s entire IT Infrastructure.

■ Easy to deploy, with minimal set up costs.
■ ‘Standard’ agents to monitor most common

environments/components/systems.

■ Open interfaces to accept any standard (e.g. SNMP)

event input and generation of multiple alerting.

■ Centralized routing of all events to a single location,

programmable to allow different location(s) at various
times.

■ Support for design/test phases – so that new
applications/services can be monitored during
design/test phases and results fed back into the
design and transition.

■ Programmable assessment and handling of alerts

depending upon symptoms and impact.

■ The ability to allow an operator to acknowledge an
alert, and if no response is entered within a defined
timeframe, to escalate the alert.

■ Good reporting functionality to allow feed-back into

design and transition phases as well a meaningful
management information and business user
‘dashboard’.

Such technology should allow a direct interface into the
organization’s Incident Management processes (via entry
into the Incident Log), as well as the capability to escalate
to support staff, third-party suppliers, engineers etc. via e-
mail, SMS messaging, etc.

Specialist facilities, or perhaps separate specialist tools, will
be required for website monitoring. Such facilities must be
able to simulate customer traffic onto the website and to
report on availability and performance in relation to the
‘customer experience’.

7.3 INCIDENT MANAGEMENT

7.4 REQUEST FULFILMENT

Technology considerations  | 159

7.3.1 Integrated ITSM technology
Integrated ITSM technology is required that has the
following functionality:

■ An integral CMS to allow automated relationships to
be made and maintained between incidents, service
requests, problems, Known Errors and all other
configuration items.

■ The CMS that can be used to assist in determining

priority and aid in investigation and diagnosis.

■ A process flow engine to allow processes to be pre-
defined (including pre-defined incident models, see
paragraph 3.2.1.5) and automatically controlled – with
flexible internal routing to all relevant support groups
and external e-mail/SMS interfaces.

■ Automated alerting and escalation capabilities to
prevent an incident being overlooked or delayed.

■ Open interfacing to Event Management tools, so that
any failures can be automatically raised as incidents.

■ A web interface to allow self-help and service requests

to be input via Internet/Intranet screens.

■ An integrated KEDB so that diagnosed and/or resolved

incident/problems can be recorded and searched to
help in speeding future incident resolution.

■ Easy-to-use reporting facilities to allow incident

metrics to be produced and to facilitate incident
analysis for Problem Management and Availability
Management purposes.

■ Diagnostic tools (either integrated or interfaces to

separate products), as already mentioned under
Service Desk.

7.3.2 Workflow and automated escalation
The target times should be included in support tools,
which should be used to automate the workflow control
and escalation paths.

If for example a second-line support group has not
resolved an incident within a 60-minute agreed target, the
incident must be automatically routed to the appropriate
(determined by incident categorization) third-line support
group – and any necessary hierarchic escalation should be
automatically undertaken (e.g. SMS message to the Service
Desk Manager, Incident Manager and/or IT Services
Manager and perhaps to the user, if appropriate). The
second-line support group must be informed of the
escalation action as part of the automated process.

Integrated ITSM technology is needed so that Service
Requests can be linked to incidents or events that have
initiated them (and been stored in the same CMS, which
can be interrogated to report against SLAs). Some
organizations will be content to use the Incident
Management element of such tools and to treat Service
Requests as a subset and defined category of incidents.
Where an organization chooses to raise separate Service
Requests, it will require a tool which allows this capability.

Front-end Self-Help capabilities will be needed to allow
users to submit requests via some form of web-based,
menu-driven selection process.

In all other respects the facilities needed to manage
Service Requests are very similar to those for managing
incidents: pre-defined workflow control of Request 
Models, priority levels, automated escalation, effective
reporting, etc.

7.5 PROBLEM MANAGEMENT

7.5.1 Integrated Service Management
Technology
An integrated ITSM tool is needed that differentiates
between incidents and problems – so that separate
Problem Records can be raised to deal with the underlying
causes of incidents, but linked to the related incidents. The
functionality of Problem Records should be similar to
those needed for Incident Records and also allow for
multiple incident matching against Problem Records.

7.5.2 Change Management
Integration with Change Management is very important,
so that Request, Event, Incident and Problem Records can
be related to RFCs that have caused problems. This is to
evaluate the success of the Change Management process
– as well as Incident and Known Error Records – and so
that RFCs can be readily raised to control the activities
needed to overcome problems that have been identified
through Root-Cause Analysis or Proactive Trend Analysis.

7.5.3 Integrated CMS
It is also important to have an integrated CMS which
allows Problem Records to be linked to the components
affected and the services impacted – and to any other
relevant CIs.

Configuration Management forms part of a larger SKMS
which includes linkages to many of the data repositories
used in Service Operations. The process and practices of

160 | Technology considerations

Configuration Management and its underlying
technologies requirements are included in the Service
Transition publication.

7.5.4 Known Error Database
An effective KEDB will be as essential requirement, 
which should allow easy storage and retrieval of Known
Error data.

Good reporting facilities are needed to ease the
production of management reports, allowing the data to
be incorporated automatically without the need for re-
keying of data – and to allow drill-down capabilities for
Incident and Problem Analysis.

Note: In some cases, components or systems being
investigated by Problem Management may be provided 
by third-party vendors or manufacturers. To address this,
vendors’ support tools and/or KEDBs may also need 
to be used.

7.6 ACCESS MANAGEMENT

Access Management uses a variety of technologies, mainly:

■ Human Resource Management technology, to validate

the identity of users and to track their status

■ Directory Services Technology (see section 5.8 for a

description of Directory Services). This technology
enables technology managers to assign names to
resources on a network and then provide access to
those resources based on the profile of the user.
Directory Services tools also enable Access
Management to create roles and groups and to link
these to both users and resources

■ Access Management features in Applications,
Middleware, Operating Systems and Network
Operating Systems

■ Change Management systems
■ Request Fulfilment technology (see section 7.4).

7.7 SERVICE DESK

Adequate tools and technology support should be
provided to enable Service Desk staff to perform their
roles as efficiently and effectively as possible. This will
include the following.

7.7.1 Telephony
Because a high percentage of incidents are likely to be
raised by telephone calls from users, the Service Desk
should be provided with good, modern telephony
services. This should include:

■ An automated call distribution (ACD) system to allow a

single telephone number (or numbers if a distributed
or segmented Service Desk is the preferred option)
and group pick-up capabilities. Warning: If options are
offered via the ACD, via keyboard or Interactive Voice
Recognition (IVR) selection, do not use too many
levels of options or offer ambiguous options. Also do
not include any ‘dead ends’ or options which, once
chosen, do not allow the caller to go back to previous
menus.

■ Computer Telephony Interface (CTI) software to allow
caller recognition (via the linked ACD) and automated
population of the users’ details into the incident
record from the CMS.

■ VoIP – use of this technology can significantly reduce

telephony costs when dealing with remote and
international users

■ Statistical software to allow telephony statistics to be
gathered and easily interrogated/printed for analysis –
this should allow the following information to be
obtained for any selected period:
● Number of calls received, in total and broken

down by any ‘splits’ – where any call-routing has
been chosen and being provided by an IVR
system/keypad response

● Call arrival profiles and answer times
● Call abandon rates
● Call handling rates by individual Service Desk 

call handlers

● Average call durations

■ Hands-free headsets, with dual-user access capabilities

(on at least some of the headsets) for use during
training of new staff, etc.

7.7.2 Support tools
There are a range of free-standing Service Desk support
tools available in the marketplace – and some
organizations may choose to produce their own simple
incident logging/management systems. If an organization
seriously intends to implement ITSM then a fully
integrated ITSM toolset will be required that has a CMS at
the centre and provides integrated support for all the ITIL-
defined processes.

Specific elements of such a tool that will be particularly
beneficial for the Service Desk include the following.

7.7.2.1 Known Error Database
An integrated KEDB should be used to store details of
previous incidents/problems and their resolutions – so that
any recurrences can be more quickly diagnosed and fixed.

Technology considerations  | 161

■ Downloads of additional software packages – tools are
available to check a pre-defined software policy and to
allow the download of additional software packages, if
covered by the policy. This can include automated
software licence checks and financial approvals as well
as CMS updating.

■ Advanced notice of any planned downtime or services

outages or degradations.

The self-help solution should include the capability for
users to log incidents themselves, which can be used
during periods that the Service Desk is closed (if not
operating 24/7) and attended to by Service Desk staff at
the start of the next shift.

Some care has to be exercised to ensure that the Self-Help
activities selected for inclusion are not too advanced for
the average user, and that safeguards are included to
prevent a ‘little knowledge being a dangerous thing’! It
may be possible to offer slightly more advanced Self-Help
facilities to ‘Super Users’ who have had extra training. It is
also necessary to be very careful about assumptions made
when staffing a Service Desk about the amount of use that
users will make of Self-Help facilities.

Note: As already covered in the list above, it is possible to
combine some simpler Request Fulfilment activities as part
of an overall Self-Help system – which can also be of
significant benefit in reducing calls to the Service Desk
(see paragraph 7.1.1 for further details).

7.7.2.4 Remote control
As already stated, but repeated here for completeness, it is
often helpful for the Service Desk Analysts to be able to
take control of the user’s desktop so as to allow them to
conduct investigations or correct settings, etc. Facilities to
allow this level of remote control will be needed.

7.7.3 IT Service Continuity Planning for
ITSM support tools
Organizations are likely to become quickly dependent
upon their ITSM tools and will find it difficult to work
without them. A full Business Impact Analysis and 
Risk Analysis should be performed and plans then
developed to ensure appropriate IT Service Continuity 
and resilience levels.

To facilitate this, functionality is needed to categorize and
quickly retrieve previous Known Errors, using pattern
matching and key word searching against symptoms.
Management of the KEDB is the responsibility of Problem
Management, but the Service Desk will use to help speed
incident handling.

7.7.2.2 Diagnostic scripts
Multi-level diagnostic scripts should be developed, stored
and managed to allow Service Desk staff to pinpoint the
cause of failures. Specialist support groups and suppliers
should be asked to provide details of the likely failures and
the key questions to be asked to identify exactly what has
gone wrong – and for details of the resolution actions to
be taken.

These details should then be included in context-sensitive
scripts that should appear on-screen, dependent upon the
multi-level categorization of the incident, and should be
driven by the user’s answers to diagnostic questions.

7.7.2.3 Self-Help web Interface
It is often cost effective and expedient to provide some
form of automated ‘Self-Help’ functionality, so users can
seek and obtain assistance which will enable them to
resolve their own difficulties. Ideally this should be via a
24/7 web interface that is driven by menu selection and
might include, as appropriate:

■ Frequently asked questions (FAQs) and solutions.
■ ‘How to do’ search capabilities – to guide users

through a context-sensitive list of tasks or activities.

■ A bulletin-type service containing details of

outstanding service issues/problems together with
anticipated restoration times.

■ Password change capabilities – using secure password

protection software to check identities, perform
authorization and change passwords without the need
for Service Desk intervention.

■ Software fix downloads (patches, service packs, bug

fixes etc. where it is determined that the user has the
wrong version or a fix is needed) – tools are available
to automate the checking process, to compare the
actual desktop image with the agreed ‘standard’ builds
and to allow upgrades to be offered and accepted
where necessary.

■ Software repairs – where it is detected that a

corruption may have occurred, to allow software fixes,
removal and/or re-installation.

■ Software removal requests – automatically completed

with any licence being returned to the pool.

Implementing Service
Operation

8 Implementing Service Operation

It should be noted that Service Operation is a phase in a
lifecycle and not an entity in its own right. By the time a
service, process, organization structure or technology is
operating, it has already been implemented. However,
there are a number of processes and functions described
in this publication, and it is therefore important to address
the implementation considerations which should have
been addressed by the time they come into operation.

A number of these have been covered in the relevant
section – for example guidance is given about
organization structures and roles in Chapter 6. This will
not be repeated here. Rather, this section will focus on
some generic implementation guidance for Service
Operation as a whole.

8.1 MANAGING CHANGE IN SERVICE
OPERATION

Service Operation should strive to achieve stability – but
not stagnation! There are many valid and advantageous
reasons why ‘change is a good thing’ – but Service
Operation staff must ensure that any changes are
absorbed without adverse impact upon the stability of the
IT services being offered.

8.1.1 Change triggers
There are many things that may trigger a change in the
Service Operation environment. These include:

■ New or upgraded hardware or network components
■ New or upgraded applications software
■ New or upgraded system software (operating systems,

utilities, middleware etc. including patches and 
bug fixes

■ Legislative, conformance or governance changes
■ Obsolescence – some components may become
obsolete and require replacement or cease to be
supported by the supplier/maintainer

■ Business imperative – you have to be flexible to work

in ITSM, particularly during Service Operation, and
there will be many occasions when the business needs
IT changes to meet dynamic business requirements

■ Enhancements to processes, procedures and/or

underpinning tools to improve IT delivery or reduce
financial costs

■ Changes of management or personnel (ranging from
loss or transfer of individuals right through to major
take-overs or acquisitions)

■ Change of service levels or in service provision –

outsourcing, in-sourcing, partnerships, etc.

8.1.2 Change assessment
Service Operation staff must be involved in the assessment
of all changes to ensure that operational issues are fully
taken into account. This involvement should commence as
soon as possible (see paragraph 4.6.1) not just at the later
stages of change – i.e. CAB and ECAB membership – by
which time many fundamental decisions will have been
made and influence is likely to be very limited. The
Change Manager should inform all affected parties of the
change being assessed so input can be prepared and
available prior to CAB meetings.

However, it is important that Service Operation staff are
involved at these latter stages as they may be involved in
the actual implementation and they will wish to ensure
that careful scheduling takes place to avoid potential
contentions or particularly sensitive periods.

8.1.3 Measurement of successful change
The ultimate measure of success in respect of changes
made to Service Operation is that customers and users do
not experience any variation or outage of service. So far as
possible, the effects of changes should be invisible, apart
from any enhanced functionality, quality or financial
savings resulting from the change.

8.2 SERVICE OPERATION AND PROJECT
MANAGEMENT

Because Service Operation is generally viewed as ‘business
as usual’ and often focused on executing defined
procedures in a standard way, there is a tendency not to
use Project Management processes when they would in
fact be appropriate. For example, major infrastructure
upgrades, or the deployment of new or changed
procedures, are significant tasks where formal Project
Management can be used to improve control and manage
costs/resources.

Using Project Management to manage these types of
activity would have the following benefits:

166 |

Implementing Service Operation

■ The project benefits are clearly stated and agreed
■ There is more visibility of what is being done and how
it is being managed, which makes it easier for other IT
groups and the business to quantify the contributions
made by operational teams

■ This in turn makes it easier to obtain funding for

projects that have traditionally been difficult to cost
justify

■ Greater consistency and improved quality
■ Achievement of objectives results in higher credibility

for operational groups.

8.3 ASSESSING AND MANAGING RISK IN
SERVICE OPERATION

There will be a number of occasions where it is imperative
that risk assessment to Service Operation is quickly
undertaken and acted upon.

The most obvious area is in assessing the risk of potential
changes or Known Errors (already covered elsewhere) but
in addition Service Operation staff may need to be
involved in assessing the risk and impact of:

■ Failures, or potential failures – either reported by

Event Management or Incident/Problem Management,
or warnings raised by manufacturers, suppliers or
contractors

■ New projects that will ultimately result in delivery into

the live environment

■ Environmental risk (encompassing IT Service

Continuity-type risks to the physical environment and
locale as well as political, commercial or industrial-
relations related risks)

■ Suppliers, particularly where new suppliers are

involved or where key service components are under
the control of third parties

■ Security risks – both theoretical or actual arising from

security related incidents or events

■ New customers/services to be supported.

8.4 OPERATIONAL STAFF IN SERVICE
DESIGN AND TRANSITION

All IT groups will be involved during Service Design and
Service transition to ensure that new components or
service are designed, tested and implemented to provide
the correct levels of functionality, usability, availability,
capacity, etc.

Additionally, Service Operation staff must be involved
during the early stages of Service Design and Service

Transition to ensure that when new services reach the live
environment they are fit for purpose, from a Service
Operation perspective, and are ‘supportable’ in the future.

In this context, ‘supportable’ means:

■ Capable of being supported from a technical and
operational viewpoint from within existing, or pre-
agreed additional resources and skills levels

■ Without adverse impact on other existing technical or
operational working practices, processes or schedules
■ Without any unexpected operational costs or ongoing

or escalating support expenditure

■ Without any unexpected contractual or legal

complications

■ No complex support paths between multiple support

departments of third-party organizations.

Note: Change is not just about technology. It also requires
training, awareness, cultural change, motivational issues
and a lot more. Further details regarding wider
management of change are covered in the Service
Transition publication.

8.5 PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING
SERVICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES

There are a number of factors that organizations need to
plan for in readiness for, and during deployment and
implementation of, ITSM support tools. These include the
following.

8.5.1 Licences
The overall cost of ITSM tools, particularly the integrated
tool that will form the heart of the required toolset, is
usually determined by the number and type of user
licences that the organization needs.

Such tools are often sold in modular format, so the exact
functionality of each module needs to be well understood
and some initial sizing must be conducted to determine
how many – and what type – of users will need access to
each module.

Licences are often available in the following types (the
exact terminology may vary depending upon the software
supplier).

8.5.1.1 Dedicated licences
For use by those staff that requires frequent and
prolonged use of the module (e.g. Service Desk staff
would need a dedicated licence to use an Incident
Management module).

Implementing Service Operation  | 167

8.5.1.2 Shared licences
For staff who make fairly regular use of the module, but
with significant intervals in between, so can usually
manage with a shared licence (e.g. third-line support staff
may need regular access to an Incident Management
module – but only at times when they are actively
updating an incident record). The ratio of required licences
to users needs to be estimated, so the correct number of
licences can be purchased – this will depend upon the
number of potential users, the length of periods of use
and the expected frequency between usages to give an
estimated concurrency level.

The cost of a shared licence is usually more expensive
than that of dedicated licences – but the overall cost is
less as users are sharing and fewer licences are therefore
needed in total.

8.5.1.3 Web licences
Usually allowing some form of ‘light interface’ via web
access to the tool’s capabilities, this is usually suitable for
staff requiring remote access, only occasional access, or
usage of just a small subset of the functionality (e.g.
engineering staff wishing to log details of actions taken on
incidents or users just wanting to log an incident directly).
Web licences usually cost a lot less than other licences
(may even be free with other licences!) and the ratio 
of use is also often lower – so overall costs are 
reduced further.

Note that some staff may require access to multiple
licences (e.g. support staff may require a dedicated or
shared licence when in the office during the day, but may
require a web licence when providing out of hours
support from home). Keep in mind that licences may be
required for customers/users/suppliers using the same tool
to input, view or update records or reports.

Note: Some licence agreements (of any of the types
mentioned above) may restrict the usage of the software
to an individual device or CPU!

8.5.1.4 Service on demand
There has been a trend within the IT industry for suppliers
to offer IT applications ‘on demand’, where access is given
to the application for a period of demand and then
severed when it is no longer needed – and charged on
the basis of the time spent using the application. This type
of offering may be offered by some ITSM tool suppliers –
which could be attractive to smaller organizations or if the
tools in question are very specialised and used relatively
infrequently.

An alternative to this is where the use of a tool is offered
as part of a specific consultancy assignment (e.g. a
specialist Capacity Management consultancy, say, who
may offer a regular but relatively infrequent Capacity
Planning consultancy package and provide use of the
tools for the duration of the assignment). In such cases the
licence fees are likely to be included as part of, or as an
addendum to, the consultancy fee.

A further variation is where software is licensed and
charged on an agent/activity basis. An example of this is
interrogation/monitoring and/or simulation software (e.g.
agent software that can simulate pre-defined customer
paths through an organization’s website, to assess and
report upon performance and availability). Such software is
typically charged on the basis of the number of agents,
their location and/or the amount of activity generated.

In all cases, full investigations of the licensing structure
must be investigated and well understood during the
procurement investigations and well before tools are
deployed – so that the ultimate costs do not come as any
sort of surprise.

8.5.2 Deployment
Many ITSM tools, particularly Discovery and Event
Monitoring tools, will require some client/agent software
deploying to all target locations before they can be used.
This will need careful planning and execution – and
should be handled through formal Release and
Deployment Management (see Service Transition
publication).

Even where network deployment is possible, this needs
careful scheduling and testing – and records must be
maintained throughout the rollout so that support staff
have knowledge of who has been upgraded and who has
not. Some form of interim Change Management may be
necessary and the CMS should be updated as the rollout
progresses.

It is often necessary for a reboot of the devices for the
client software to be recognized – and this needs to be
arranged in advance, otherwise long delays can occur if
staff do not generally switch off their desktops overnight.

There may be particular problems deploying to laptops
and other portable equipment and special arrangements
may be necessary for staff to log on and receive the 
new software.

8.5.3 Capacity checks
Some Capacity Management may be necessary in advance
to ensure that all of the target locations have sufficient

168 |

Implementing Service Operation

storage and processing capacity to host and run the new
software – any that cannot will need upgrading or
replacing, and lead times for these actions need to be
included in the plans.

The capacity of the network should also be checked to
establish whether it can handle the transmission of
management information, the transmission of log files and
the distribution of clients’ and also possibly software and
configuration files.

8.5.4 Timing of technology deployment
Care is needed to ensure that tools are deployed at the
appropriate time in relation to the organization’s level of
ITSM sophistication and knowledge. If tools are deployed
too soon, they may be seen as an immediate panacea and
any necessary action to change processes, working
practices or attitudes may be hindered or overlooked.

A tool alone is usually not enough to make things work
better. There is an old adage: ‘A fool with a tool is 
still a fool!’

for an additional period when the tools go live and into
the future, as needed.

8.5.5 Type of introduction
A decision is needed on what type of introduction is
needed – whether to go for a ‘Big Bang’ introduction or
some sort of phased approach. As most organizations will
not start from a ‘green field’ situation, and will have live
services to keep running during the introduction, a phased
approach is more likely to be necessary.

In many cases a new tool will be replacing an older,
probably less sophisticated, tool and the switchover
between the two is another factor to be planned.

This will often involve deciding what data needs to be
carried forward from the old tool to the new one – and
this may require significant reformatting to achieve the
required results. Ideally this transfer should be done
electronically – but in some cases a small amount of re-
keying of live data may be inevitable and should be
factored into the plans.

The organization must first examine the processes that the
tool is seeking to address and also ensure that staff are
‘bought in’ to the new processes and way of working and
have a adopted a ‘service culture’.

Caution: older tools generally relied on more manual entry
and maintenance of data so if electronic data migration is
being used, an audit should be performed to verify data
quality.

However, tools can and often do make things a reality for
many people – they are tangible and technical staff can
immediately see how the new processes can work and
how they may improve their way of working.

Some processes just cannot be done without adequate
tooling, so there is a careful balance to be made to ensure
tools are introduced when they are needed – but not
before!

Similarly, care is needed to ensure that training in any
tools is provided at the correct point – not too early or
knowledge will diminish or be lost, but early enough so
that staff can be formally trained and fully familiarize
themselves with the operation of the tools well in advance
of live deployment. Additional training should be planned

Where data transfer is complicated or time consuming to
achieve, an alternative might be to allow a period of
parallel running – with the old tool being available for an
initial period alongside the new one, so that historical data
can be referenced if needed. In such cases it will be
prudent to make the old tool ‘read-only’ so that no
mistakes can be made by logging new data in the old
tool.

Complete details on the Release and Deployment
Management process can be found in the Service
Transition publication.

risks

9.1 CHALLENGES

There are a number of challenges faced within Service
Operation that need to be overcome. These include those
set out in this section.

9.1.1 Lack of engagement with
development and project staff
Traditionally, there has been a separation between Service
Operation staff and those staff involved in developing new
applications or running projects that will eventually deliver
new functionality into the operational environment.

This separation was originally deliberate and driven by 
the desire to prevent collusion and avoid potential 
security risks (in some organizations it is still a 
legislative requirement). However, instead of using 
this separation of duties to create positive contributions, 
in many organizations it is a source of rivalry and 
political manoeuvring.

All too often, ITSM is seen as something that has been
initiated in the operational areas and is nothing to do with
development or projects.

This view is very damaging as the appropriate time to be
thinking of Service Operation issues is at the outset of new
developments or projects – when there is still time to
include these factors in the planning stages.

The Service Design and Service Transition publications
describe the steps needed to ensure that IT Operations
issues are considered from the outset of new
developments and projects.

Anecdotes

One organization uses an ‘Operation Transition-In
Policy’ to ensure that services being deployed have
had the appropriate level of input from the
operational teams. This is basically a policy that
clearly shows under what circumstances an
application is ‘ready’ to transition into Operations.
This helped with communication to development and
project teams and also provided a clear set of
guidelines on how to work with the operational teams.

Another organization uses Operations Use Cases to
get development teams to include requirements that
should be fulfilled by the application to be run in
production under the control of Operations personnel.

9.1.2 Justifying funding
It is often difficult to justify expenditure in the area of
Service Operation, as money spent in this sphere is often
regarded as ‘infrastructure costs’ – with nothing new to
show for the investment.

The Service Strategy publication discusses how to ensure a
Return on Investment and eliminate the perception of
investment as a purely Infrastructure ‘overhead’. Good
guidance is offered on how to justify investment.

In reality, many investments in ITSM, particularly in the
Service Operation areas, can save money and show a
positive Return on Investment – as well as resulting
improvement in service quality. Some examples of
potential areas of savings include:

■ Reduced software licence costs through the better

management of licences and deployed copies

■ Reduced support costs due to fewer incidents and

problems and reduced resolution times

■ Reduced headcount through workforce rationalization,

supporting roles and accountability structures

■ Less ‘lost business’ due to poor IT service quality
■ Better utilization of existing infrastructure equipment

and deferral of further expenditure due to better
capacity management

■ Better-aligned processes, leading to less duplication of

activities and better usage of existing resources.

9.1.3 Challenges for Service Operation
Managers
The following is a list of some of the challenges that
Managers in Service Operation should expect to face.
There is no easy solution to these challenges, mainly
because they are by-products of the organization culture
and the decisions made during the process of deciding
the organizational structure. The purpose of including the
list is to ensure that Service Operation Managers are
conscious of them and can create a plan to deal with
them.

The differences between Design activities and Operational
activities will continue to present challenges. This is for a
number of reasons, including the following:

172 | Challenges, Critical Success Factors and risks

■ Service Design may tend to focus on an individual

service at a time, whereas Service Operation tends to
focus on delivering and supporting all services at the
same time. Operation Managers should work closely
with Service Design and Service Transition to provide
the Operation perspective to ensure that design 
and transition outcomes support the overall
operational needs.

■ Service Design will often be conducted in projects,

while Service Operation focuses on ongoing,
repeatable management processes and activities. The
result of this is that operational staff are often not
available to participate in Service Design project
activities, which in turn results in IT services that are
difficult to operate, or which do not include adequate
manageability design elements. In addition, once
project staff have finished the design of one IT Service
they could move onto the next project and not be
available to support difficulties in the operational
environment. Overcoming this challenge requires
Service Operation to plan for its staff to be actively
involved in design projects, to resource the transition
activities and participate in Early Life Support of
services introduced in the operational environment.

■ The two stages in the lifecycle have different metrics,

which encourages Service Design to complete the
project on time, to specification and in budget. In
many cases it is difficult to forecast what the service
will look like and how much it will cost after it has
been deployed and operated for some time. When it
does not run as expected, IT Operations Management
is held responsible. While this challenge will always be
a reality in Service Management, this can be addressed
by active involvement in the Service Transition stage
of the lifecycle. The objective of Service Transition is to
ensure that designed services will operate as expected
and the Operations Manager can provide the
knowledge needed to Service Transition to assess, and
remedy, issues before they become issues in the
operational environment.

■ Service Transition that is not used effectively to
manage the transition between the Design and
Operation phases. For example, some organizations
may only use Change Management to schedule the
deployment of changes that have already been made
– rather than testing to see whether the change will
successfully make the transition between Design and
Operation. It is imperative that the practices of Service
Transition are followed and organization policies to
prevent poorly managed Change practices are in
place. Operation, Change and Transition Managers
must have the authority to deny any changes into the
operational environment, without exception, that are
not thoroughly tested.

These challenges can only be dealt with if Service
Operation staff are involved in Service Design and
Transition, and this will require that they are formally
tasked and measured to do this. Roles identified in the
Service Design processes should be included in Technical
and IT Application Management staff job descriptions and
their time allocated on a project-by-project basis.

Another set of challenges relates to measurement. Each
alternative structure will introduce different combinations
of items that are easy or difficult to measure. For example
measuring the performance of a device or team could be
relatively easy, but determining whether that performance
is good or bad for the overall IT Service is another matter
altogether. A good Service Level Management process will
help to resolve this, but this means that Service Operation
teams must be an integral part of that process (see
Continual Service Improvement publication).

A third set of challenges relates to the use of Virtual
Teams. Traditional, hierarchical management structures are
becoming inadequate because of the complexity and
diversity of most organizations. A management paradigm
(Matrix Management) has emerged where employees
report to different sources for different tasks. This has
resulted in a complex web of accountability and an
increased risk of activities falling through the cracks. On
the other hand, it also enables the organization to make
skills and knowledge available where they are most
needed to support the business. Knowledge Management
and the mapping of authority structures will become
increasingly important as organizations expand and
diversify. This is discussed in the ITIL Service Strategy
publication.

One of the most significant challenges faced by Service
Operation Managers is the balancing of many internal and
external relationships. Most IT organizations today are
complex and as services become more commoditized

Challenges, Critical Success Factors and risks  | 173

there is an increased use of value networks, partnerships
and shared services models. While a significant advantage
to dynamically evolving business needs, this increases the
complexity of managing services cohesively, efficiently and
providing the invisible seam between the customer and
the intricate web of how services are actually delivered. A
Service Operation Manager should invest in relationship
management knowledge and skills to help deal with the
complexity of this challenge.

should go out of their way to make their support known,
not just by their words but also by their actions and
adherence to the organization’s agreed processes 
and procedures.

Middle Managers should also give their full support to
hiring staff to support the process, instead of accepting
the need for formalized Service Operation and then simply
increasing the workload of existing staff to get it done.

9.2 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

9.2.1 Management support
Senior and Middle Management support is needed for all
ITSM activities and processes, particularly in Service
Operation.

Senior Management support is critical for obtaining and
maintaining adequate funding and resourcing. Rather than
seeing Service Operation as a ‘black hole’ for investment,
Senior Management should quantify and champion the
benefits of good Service Operation. They should also be
fully informed of the dire results that can occur because of
poor Service Operation.

Senior Management must provide visible support during
the launch of new Service Operation initiatives (such as
through appearances at seminars, signatories to memos
and announcements, etc.) and their ongoing support must
be equally well demonstrated. Entirely the wrong
messaging can be given if a senior manager fails to turn
up to an important project meeting or launch seminar.
Even worse are senior managers who support the initiative
verbally, but abuse their authority to encourage
circumvention of the Service Operation practice.

Senior Managers should also empower the Middle
Managers who will be directly responsible for Service
Operation. Supporting the initiative publicly, but then
overriding budget requirements or necessary changes, will
harm both the implementation and ongoing Service
Operation initiative.

Middle Managers must also provide the necessary support
– and in particular this should be demonstrated by their
actions. If a Middle Manager is seen to be circumventing
or overriding an agreed procedure (e.g. implementing a
change that has not been through the Change
Management process) then this gives the clear message
that others can do the same – and that the procedure is
worthless and can be ignored by all. Middle Managers

9.2.2 Business support
It is important that the Business Units also support Service
Operation. This level of support can be far better achieved
if the Service Operation staff involve the business in all of
their activities and are open in their reporting of both
successes and failures – and their efforts to improve.

It is equally important that the Business Units understand,
accept and carry out the role they play in Service
Operation. Good service requires good customers!
Adhering to the policies, processes and procedures, such
as using the Service Desk for logging all requests, is a
direct responsibility of the customer to support and
promote within the business.

Regular communications with the business to understand
their concerns and aspirations and to give feedback on
efforts to meet their needs are essential in building the
correct relationships and ensuring ongoing support.

Also the business should agree to the costs for
implementing Service Operation and understand the
return on the investment, unless this has already been
agreed as part of the Design process.

9.2.3 Champions
ITSM projects and the resulting ongoing practice
(performed by Service Operation staff) are often more
successful if one or more ‘champions’ are forthcoming
who can lead others through their enthusiasm and
commitment for ITSM.

In some cases these champions may be senior managers
who are leading from the top. But champions can also be
successful if they come from other tiers of the
organization. One or two junior staff can still have a
significant beneficial influence on a successful conclusion.

Champions are often created or heavily influenced
through formal Service Management training, particularly
at more advanced levels where the potential benefits to
an organization, and to the individuals who make a career
path in Service Management, can be fully explored.

174 | Challenges, Critical Success Factors and risks

It should be noted that champions emerge over time.
They cannot be created or appointed. Often it is users or
customers who provide the most help in creating good
Service Management processes as they are acutely aware
of needed improvements from a business perspective. It is
important to recognize that these are usually highly
motivated staff who often voluntarily take on the greatest
workloads. If their input is to be most effective they must
be given time to work as the champion.

9.2.4 Staffing and retention
Having the appropriate number of staff with the
appropriate skills is critical to the success of Service
Operation. Some challenges that need to be 
overcome include the following:

■ Projects for new services are usually quite good about
specifying required new skills, but often underestimate
the number of staff required and how to retain the
new skills. See paragraph 9.2.1 for some ideas on how
to facilitate better communication about requirements.
■ Scarcity of resources who have a good understanding
of Service Management. Having good technical people
is necessary, but there needs to be a number of key
people who are able to move between technology
issues and service issues.

■ Since these resources are fairly scarce it is quite

common to train them, only to have them resign and
join another company for a better salary. Clear career
paths and good incentives should be part of every
Service Management initiative.

■ Attempting to assign too much, too soon, to existing

staff. Achieving efficient Service Operation will take
time, but if approached correctly it will be achieved.
Unfortunately, some managers try to expedite the
savings by assigning the interim work of
implementing the new processes and tools to existing,
very busy, staff. Invariably either the project fails, or
service suffers and sometimes valuable staff will leave.
Successful Service Management projects often require
a short-term investment in either temporary staff or
contractors, and this should not be underestimated.

9.2.5 Service Management training
Adequate training and awareness can have much wider
overall benefits. As well as creating champions of a few, it
can be used to win the ‘hearts and minds’ of many.
Service Operation staff must all be aware of the
consequences of their actions, both good and bad, on the

organization – and all must be instilled with a ‘Service
Management culture’.

It is possible to have the finest Service Operation practice
and tools in the world – but Service Management will not
be successful unless the people are also attuned to the
overall Service Management objectives. Buy-in and
support of all staff are therefore very important – and the
role of training and awareness, and even formal
qualifications that benefit the individual, should not be
underestimated.

Training required for successful Service Management
includes:

■ Training IT staff on the processes that have been

implemented. This will include generic training so that
they understand the concepts fully, as well as training
specially targeted at the organization’s own processes
■ Training on ‘soft’ or ‘people’ skills, especially for those

staff in customer-facing positions

■ Training about understanding the business, and the

importance of achieving a service culture

■ Where tools have been implemented, training on how

to use and manage those tools 

■ Also, customers and users need appropriate training

on how to work with IT – access services, request
changes, submit requests, use tools, etc.

9.2.6 Suitable tools
Many Service Operation processes and activities cannot be
performed effectively without adequate support tools (as
outlined in Chapter 7). Senior management must ensure
that funding for such tools is included in ongoing budgets
and support their procurement, deployment and ongoing
maintenance.

9.2.7 Validity of testing
The quality of IT services that can be provided in Service
Operation is dependent upon the quality of systems and
components delivered into the operational environment.

The quality level will be significantly enhanced if adequate
and complete testing of new components and releases is
carried out in good time. Documentation should also be
tested for completeness and quality.

This requires a comprehensive and realistic testing
environment to be in place for all systems/components –
which mirrors the operational environment in terms of
volume as well as characteristics. There should be

Challenges, Critical Success Factors and risks  | 175

■ Loss of key personnel: Sometimes the loss of one or
two key personnel can have a severe impact: to try to
minimize this effect, organizations should seek to
cross-train staff and reduce dependencies upon
individuals. This is especially true in less mature
organizations where knowledge has still not been
formalised into processes, documents and tools. These
organizations tend to be dependent on ‘heroic’ efforts
of a few knowledgeable people, and are devastated
when they leave.

■ Resistance to change: Sometimes people object to
new things and are reluctant to take them on board.
Education, training, communication and highlighting
benefits will help.

■ Lack of management support: This often occurs

among Middle Managers, who may not see the overall
vision or gain the hands-on benefits that more junior
staff may gain. See paragraph 9.2.1 for more
information on this, but managers need to support
Service Management and participate in the
appropriate phases and processes of Service Design,
Transition and Operation to provide tangible support.

■ If the initial design is faulty, a successful

implementation will never give the required results –
and redesign will ultimately be necessary.

■ In some organizations Service Management can be

viewed with suspicion by both IT and the business. IT
staff see it as an attempt to control them, while the
business perceives it as an attempt by IT to gain more
funding without actually improving anything. The
benefits of Service Management should be clearly
articulated for all stakeholders.

■ Differing customer expectations. While operational

staff are encouraged to execute against standards,
customer and user expectations sometimes differ. In
other cases one customer may have paid more for a
superior service, but when a user from a different area
sees the superior service, they feel cheated. This
problem should be resolved through clear SLM and
careful communication during Service Design.
Complaints of this nature should be taken up through
Continual Service Improvement processes and should
not simply involve Service Operation automatically
increasing service upon request.

independent testers wherever possible. Funding for such
testing environments is essential if high-quality services
are to be achieved.

Additionally, sufficient time and effort are needed to
ensure that testing is properly planned and designed –
and adequate time is included for testing, and re-testing
should some parts fail! The best way to ensure this is by
following the guidance in the Service Transition
publication.

9.2.8 Measurement and reporting
A clear definition is needed of how things will be
measured and reported (as outlined in Appendix B) so that
all staff have clear targets to aim for and IT and Business
Managers are able to quickly and easily review progress
and pinpoint any areas for attention.

9.3 RISKS

Failure to meet the challenges already described in section
9.1 or to address the Critical Success Factors outlined in
section 9.2 are obvious risks – but others are described 
as set out below.

9.3.1 Service loss
The ultimate risk to the business of weaknesses in Service
Operation is the loss of critical IT services with subsequent
adverse impact on its employees, customers and finances.
In extreme cases there may be potential loss to life and
limb where the IT services affected are used for critical
health or safety purposes – such as emergency vehicle
deployment or health scanning, etc.

9.3.2 Risks to successful Service Operation
The risks to achieving successful Service Operation are
numerous – and in many cases are the opposite of the
Critical Success Factors as described earlier – but also
include:

■ Inadequate funding and resources: Funding must

be justified, allocated and held in reserve for its
original purpose.

■ Loss of momentum: Where staff see Service

Management as ‘flavour of the month’ rather than
permanently changing the way they work for the
future, any impetus is lost as a result: it must be made
clear from the outset that a new way of working is
required. Also, mechanisms should be in place to
ensure that the initiative survives organizational
changes.

Afterword

| 179

Afterword

A simple truth must guide us all in Service Operation.
Business and technology will continue to evolve into the
future. What was innovative last year is common this year.
What is best practice today will be common tomorrow.
Achieving excellence in Service Operation requires
flexibility, balance and good judgement in the use of ITIL
practices. The guidance in this publication is a key to
achieving knowledge, wisdom, future vision and the ability
to balance today’s business needs and tomorrow’s
demand.

Common, good, best and future practices all contribute to
the goal of service excellence. ITIL provides these as the
basis for guiding you toward this goal.

Stability in a changing world is the reality for Service
Providers. Those who excel, and remain the best of breed,
understand this and know that the way to achieve is to
adapt, learn, innovate and lead.

The Service Operation publication is an integral part of an
overall ITSM Lifecycle practice, Used together, the ITIL
Practice for Service Management forms a powerful tool in
the hands of any Service Provider.

Appendix A: Complementary industry
guidance

When ITIL was first introduced in the 1980s, there was
little else available in terms of non-proprietary guidance
on ITSM best practice.

Today, there are other frameworks or methodologies 
that have valid contributions to make in this area, that
complement and have synergy with ITIL and which can 
be of assistance to Service Operation.

A1

COBIT

The COBIT framework, produced by the Information
Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) and
managed by the IT Governance Institute, provides a 
very useful framework of guidance for IT audit and 
security personnel.

The current version of COBIT, edition 4, includes 
34 High Level Control Objectives, 13 of which are 
grouped under the ‘Deliver and Support Domain’, which
maps quite closely onto ITIL’s Service Operation phase.
These are entitled:

■ DS1 Define and manage service levels.
■ DS2 Manage third-party services.
■ DS3 Manage performance and capacity.
■ DS4 Ensure continuous service.
■ DS5 Ensure systems security.
■ DS6 Identify and allocate costs.
■ DS7 Educate and train users.
■ DS8 Manage service desk and incidents.
■ DS9 Manage the configuration.
■ DS10 Manage problems.
■ DS11 Manage data.
■ DS12 Manage the physical environment.
■ DS13 Manage operations.

Some aspects of Service Operation are also touched upon
in some of the control objectives within other domains –
but the vast majority of what COBIT has to say about the
‘live operation’ phase of IT is contained in the
abovementioned control objectives.

COBIT is primarily aimed at auditors, so has an emphasis
on what should be audited and how, rather than including
detailed guidance for those who are operating the

processes that will be audited – but it has a lot of valid
material which organizations may find useful.

It should be noted that COBIT and ITIL are not
‘competitive’ nor are they mutually exclusive – on the
contrary, they can be used in conjunction as part of an
organization’s overall managerial and governance
framework. ITIL provides an organization with best-
practice guidance on how to manage and improve its
process to deliver high-quality, cost-effective IT services.
COBIT provides guidance on how these processes should
be audited and assessed to determine whether they are
operating as intended and giving optimum benefit for the
organization.

For a more complete overall picture, organizations may
wish to read and become familiar with what COBIT has to
say alongside their reading and understanding of ITIL.

ISO/IEC 20000

In December 2005 the International Standards
Organization launched a formal international standard,
ISO/ISE 20000, against which organizations can seek
independent accreditation for ITSM. This was preceded by
a British Standard, BS15000, which was originally
introduced in 2000 and under which some organizations
became accredited, but was superseded by ISO/ISE 20000
and accreditations were carried over.

While ISO/IEC 20000 initially mapped to the prior Service
Support and Service Delivery publications of ITIL, the
standard continues to map well to ITIL today and also
covers IT Security, Business Relationship Management and
Supplier Management.

For organizations seeking formal accreditation to ISO/IEC
20000, so as to get external, international recognition for
the success of their ITSM processes, there will be a
significant involvement by Service Operation staff in
preparing for and undergoing the formal surveillance
necessary to achieve the standard.

Further details of the standard can be found via the itSMF
at www.itsmf.com or the ISO at www.iso.org

CMMI

A5 QUALITY MANAGEMENT

The Capability Maturity Model® Integration (CMMI) is a
process improvement approach developed by the
Software Engineering Institute (SEI) of Carnegie Mellon
University. CMMI provides organizations with the essential
elements of effective processes. It can be used to guide
process improvement across a project, a division, or an
entire organization. CMMI helps integrate traditionally
separate organizational functions, set process
improvement goals and priorities, provide guidance for
quality processes and provide a point of reference for
appraising current processes. For more information, see
http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/

A number of IT consultancy organizations have built the
maturity model into their ITSM assessment services as a
way of assisting organizations prepare for and judge
process improvements – including those in the Service
Operation area. Organizations may wish to use some form
of the model to help drive their path towards independent
ISO/ISE 20000 accreditation.

A4

BALANCED SCORECARD

A new approach to strategic management was developed
in the early 1990s by Drs. Robert Kaplan (Harvard Business
School) and David Norton. They named this system the
‘Balanced Scorecard’. Recognizing some of the weaknesses
and vagueness of previous management approaches, the
balanced scorecard approach provides a clear prescription
as to what companies should measure in order to
‘balance’ the financial perspective. The Balanced Scorecard
suggests that the organization is viewed from four
perspectives, and it is valuable to develop metrics, collect
data and analyse it relative to each of these perspectives:

■ The Learning and Growth Perspective
■ The Business Process Perspective
■ The Customer Perspective
■ The Financial Perspective.

Some organizations may choose to use the Balanced
Scorecard method as a way of assessing and reporting
their IT quality performance in general and their Service
Operation performance in particular.

Further details are available through the Balanced
Scorecard User Community at www.scorecardsupport.com

There are distinct advantages of tying an organization’s
ITSM processes, and Service Operation processes in
particular, to its quality management system. If an
organization has a formal quality management system
such as ISO9000, Six Sigma, TQM etc. then this can be
used to assess progress regularly and drive forward agreed
service improvement initiatives through regular reviews
and reporting.

Many organizations have used a regular annual audit or
external assessment as a way of determining the required
improvements – and then their Quality Management
system to drive through the specific programmes of work.

A6

ITIL AND THE OSI FRAMEWORK

At around the time that ITIL v1 was being written, the
International Standards Organization launched an initiative
that resulted in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
framework. Since this initiative covered many of the same
areas as did the ITIL team, it is not surprising that they
covered much of the same ground.

However, it is also not surprising that they classified their
processes differently, used different terminology, or used
the same terminology in different ways. To confuse
matters even more, it is common for different groups in an
organization to use terminology from both ITIL and the
OSI framework.

Although it is not in the scope of this publication to
explore the OSI framework, it has made significant
contributions to the definition and execution of ITSM
programmes and projects around the world. It has also
caused a great deal of debate between teams that do not
realize the origins of the terminology that they are using.

For example, some organizations have two Change
Management departments – one following the ITIL
Change Management process and the other using the
OSI’s Installation, Moves, Additions and Changes (IMAC)
model. Each department is convinced that it is completely
different from the other, and that they perform different
roles. Closer examination will reveal that there are several
areas of commonality.

In Service Operation, the management of Known Errors
may be mapped to Fault Management. There is also a
section related to Operational Capacity Management,
which can be related to the OSI’s concept of Performance
Management.

COMMUNICATION

Most communication in Service Operation has to do with
ensuring that all teams and departments are able to
execute the standard activities involved in delivering IT
services and managing the IT infrastructure.

Serious consideration should be given during Service
Design to defining the content, type and format of
communication that is required to operate IT services.

Table B.1 Communication requirements in IT services

Purpose

■ To coordinate the regular activities of Service Operation at all levels.

Frequency

Role Players

Content

■ To ensure that all staff are aware of the scheduled activity at all times and that they are aware of any changes

or initiatives that may affect the normal operation of the IT environment

This type of communication is regular and is communicated in daily, weekly and monthly cycles

■ All managers and staff involved in Service Operation
■ All process managers for processes executed by Service Operation staff – especially Change, Incident and

Problem Management
■ Customers and users
■ Vendor staff involved in Service Operation

■ Summarize events since the previous communication to ensure that everyone is aware of any follow-up that
needs to occur. Also to ensure that all batches have completed and the teams or departments are ready for
standard operational activity

■ A report on the health of major systems
■ Inform Operations Management staff of any news or events that may effect operations that period
■ Discuss any outstanding problems or incidents and ensure that an action plan is in place for each
■ Discuss the schedule of changes that are expected to be made during the day, together with a briefing of

potential incidents that may occur as a result and the appropriate action to be taken. This should not be
confused with the CAB meeting. This is an opportunity to check whether changes that were agreed and
scheduled by the CAB, or through a Change Model, are still on track

■ Any planned maintenance or other outages that have been scheduled for the next operational period
■ Announcement of the results of any Post Mortem or Crisis meetings that were held since the previous

communication

■ Announcement or reminder of training that may be available over the next week or month to give staff and

their supervisors time to schedule the training into the Operations Schedule

Context/sources ■ Operations Logs
■ Incident Reports
■ Problem Reports
■ Maintenance Schedules
■ Change Schedule

COMMUNICATION BETWEEN SHIFTS

Not all organizations work in shifts, but for those who do,
Table B.2 will summarize the communication that needs to
take place between shifts.

Purpose

This communication ensures that the handover between outgoing and incoming shifts is smooth and also makes
the new shift aware of any potential difficulties. They also ensure that the new shift is aware of any tasks that
need to be completed.

Role Players

Content

■ Shift leaders of each shift
■ Staff from each shift who perform similar tasks ·

■ A summary report on operations undertaken during the previous shift
■ A summary of all exceptions and alerts that were resolved during the shift 
■ Details of any outstanding exceptions and alerts, with information about all actions taken to the current point

and any information about anticipated future actions (e.g. a vendor is expected to be on site to provide
support during the next four hours)·

Context/sources Communication between shifts will usually be based on the following sources:·

■ Shift logs
■ Shift Leader’s report
■ Interpersonal verbal or electronic ‘chat’ communication where shift personnel are in different facilities

PERFORMANCE REPORTING

Performance Reporting in the context of communication
refers to three main areas, as set out below.

IT Service Performance
This category of Performance Reporting is generally done
as part of SLM and is covered in the Continual Service
Improvement publication. However, there is a very
important aspect of Service Reporting that concerns
Service Operation, namely that it is the Service Operation
teams or departments that are required to record and
communicate the information that goes into these reports.

However, Service Operation staff are not in the best
position to decide on the content, format and frequency
of Service Performance Reporting. The requirements for
this type of communication have to be to be clearly
defined during Service Design and refined during
Continual Service Improvement.

Service Operation team or department performance
This is an ‘internal’ communication in that it takes place
between the members of a team or department and their
manager, or a process manager and the team that
executes the process. People outside of these teams or
departments should not be involved in this type of
communication as it is aimed at managing people rather
than measuring the quality of a service.

However, it is a common mistake for IT departments to
communicate this type of information to customers as if it
were the same as reporting on Service Quality. For
example, a manager might report that their department
solves 80% of all problems. As far as the average user is
concerned, however, this information is irrelevant. They are
more concerned with whether their IT Service performed
as agreed. In addition, disclosing internal information to
customers and users could be embarrassing for the Service
Operation teams and departments and could result in high
levels of interference from the business to ‘correct’
perceived problems.

To provide information to the groups responsible for IT Service reporting to customers and users, which they can
use to demonstrate the achievement of service targets and as input to Service Level Review meetings The
information can also be used as a basis for charging for IT services

As defined in the SLAs and OLAs. This information is usually communicated regularly on a daily, monthly and
quarterly basis.

■ Service Operation teams and departments, usually IT Operations staff
■ SLM staff
■ Service Design teams (who help to define performance standards and refine these through Continual Service

Improvement)

■ Continual Service Improvement teams, especially those tasked with Service Reporting

Examples of the type of Service Performance information that needs to be communicated to enable reporting on
Service Performance are:
■ Achievement of specific activities as defined in OLAs
■ Achievement of targets for delivery of specified outputs
■ Service or system availability achievements
■ Ability to meet Service Maintenance Objectives within targeted times and impact levels

Context/sources ■ Monitoring and reporting tools

■ Event Logs
■ Shift Logs

Table B.4 Performance Reporting requirements: Service Operation team or department

Purpose

There are three main purposes of Service Operation team or department Performance communication:

■ Proactively, to ensure that Service Operation staff are executing the activities required to deliver IT services

and to support the IT Infrastructure

■ To detect potential issues with resource levels, capability and circumvention of procedures
■ To ensure that corrective action has been correctly implemented and adhered to

Frequency

There is no set frequency for this type of communication. Although some Performance Reports may be produced
daily, weekly or monthly, most managers are involved in ongoing communication with their teams or
departments as the situation requires.

Under normal operating situations, this communication will tend to be less frequent than in situations where
there is a high degree of change or where the organization is experiencing high numbers and severity of
incidents

Role Players

Content

■ Service Operation Managers
■ Service Operation staff
■ Performance issues may be escalated to the Service Manager or CIO

■ Comparison between required and actual performance
■ Trends of performance over time
■ Specific reports of misconduct or failure to perform a required action

Context/sources ■ Regular performance reports, e.g. Incident Logs, maintenance records, process metrics

■ Interpersonal and verbal communication during working situations
■ Team or department meetings
■ Coaching by a team leader or manager
■ Investigation following a poor Service Report may initiate a series of communications in Service Operation
■ Individual Performance Appraisals, usually using (KPIs) documented in the individual’s job description

Infrastructure or process performance
As with team or department performance, this is an
‘internal’ communication that takes place between the
members of a team or department who are responsible for
managing an infrastructure component or system, or the
members of a process team. People outside of these
teams should not be involved in this type of
communication as it is aimed at managing people rather
than measuring the quality of a service.

Appendix B: Communication in Service Operation  | 191

Table B.5 Performance Reporting requirements: infrastructure or process

Purpose

There are at least three purposes of this type of communication:·
■ To ensure normal operation of the infrastructure or a process
■ To detect potential issues with the infrastructure or process concerned
■ To ensure that corrective action has been taken and that it was effective

Frequency

The frequency of this type of communication will vary depending on the nature of the system(s) being managed
or the process being executed.

Some components of the infrastructure are more volatile and will require frequent communications and even
meetings to ensure that it performs predictably. More stable components will simply require a confirmation that
everything is still working as expected.

Some processes have a requirement of frequent reporting and communication. For example, Incident
Management may require updates every five minutes for a high-impact incident. Other processes do not need to
communicate that frequently. For example Capacity Planning needs to communicate changes on a monthly or
even quarterly basis.

COMMUNICATION IN PROJECTS

Service Operation staff are often involved in projects. This
may be to provide input to a new design, or to assist in
verifying utilization or throughput rates, or to assist in
conducting tests of new or changed services. In other
cases the projects may affect existing OLAs and their
feedback will be required. It must be recognized that this
involvement will add to the level of communication that
these individuals will be receiving and transmitting. This
will require additional time and focus, which should be
allowed for by managers assigning resources to projects
on a part-time basis.

Formal project communication tends to follow the cycle of
project meetings. For example:

■ Weekly or monthly project meetings will be held with

the Project Manager and the individual team leaders
■ A monthly status update will be sent to the project’s

Executive Sponsor and possibly other key stakeholders

Table B.6 Communication within projects

■ Exceptions and the result of quality assurance checks

are reported into Project Assurance teams, who in turn
will communicate the need for corrective action as
necessary.

Inside each team, communication will be more focused on
completing their tasks and will generally be more frequent
than the project-wide communication.

There is likely to be a high level of less formal
communication inside each team and also between teams
to ensure that tasks are completed on time and promised
resources are available when and where they are
supposed to be. Extensive communication is also required
as part of the handover from one team to another as the
project moves from one stage or phase to another. An
important rule of thumb is to document any
communication that could potentially affect the outcome
or the cost of the project.

Purpose

Project communication as multiple purposes, including:
■ To gain support from project stakeholders – this communication will focus on the scope, cost and benefits

of the project and will seek to demonstrate an overall return on the project’s investment

■ To ensure that all members of the project team understand and are aligned to the objectives of the project
■ To assign work to individuals or teams
■ To schedule activities and ensure that resources are ready to begin their stage of the project
■ To check on and report the progress of the project
■ To detect and escalate potential exceptions or delays in the project
■ To prepare project customers and audiences for the rollout of the solution being built

Frequency

The frequency, role players and content of communication will depend on the nature of the project and the type
of Project Management methodology being used

CHANGES

Change Management is covered in detail in the ITIL
Service Transition publication and includes information
about change communication. However, it is necessary to
stress the nature of operational communication about
changes.

Table B.8 Communication about changes

Purpose

To support the Change Management process by:·
■ Assessing the potential impact of and resources required for the change
■ Ensuring that each team is aware of the nature and schedule of changes that have been assigned to them
■ Building, testing and deploying changes in their environment
■ Ensuring that each team reports that progress on each change
■ Notifying Change Management that a change is ready for deployment
■ Backing out changes that were unsuccessful and communicating the results to Change Management
■ Assisting in the assessment of changes to ensure that they have been implemented correctly

Frequency

The frequency of communication related to changes is determined by the nature of the change and the times
set forth in the Change Schedule.

Most teams or departments will review changes on a daily or weekly basis. Each day they will discuss and
prioritize all new changes assigned to them and report on the progress of changes they are working on. After
each change they will report on the success of each change and ensure that any remedial action required is
initiated.

Role Players

■ Change Manager, administrators and coordinators
■ Team-leaders, Department Heads, Shift Managers or Project Managers
■ Service Operation staff involved in building, testing and deploying changes (usually Technical, Application and

IT Operations Management teams or department)

■ Managers of Test Environments and teams
■ Change or Release Deployment teams

Content

■ Requests for and authorization of changes
■ Reports on the feasibility of a change
■ Reports on the resources required to build, test or deploy a change
■ Change Activity Scheduling
■ Detailed descriptions of the change and the activities required of each team or department
■ Progress and status reporting of change activity
■ Test results
■ Exception Reports, including details of the execution of Back-out Plans

Context/sources ■ RFCs

■ Change Control communication (during daily or weekly operational meetings, or by e-mail, conference call or

using the Change Management tools)

■ Change Advisory Board meetings
■ Release Plans 
■ Projected Service Outage reports

EXCEPTIONS

In this context an exception refers to any occurrence that
is outside normal or expected activity or performance. The
most common form of exception is an Incident (which is
covered in detail in section 4.2 of this publication). There
are other exceptions that do not necessarily go through
Incident Management, such as a process exception (which

will be handled in the context of that process or by a
Quality Assurance process); a team, department or
individual whose performance is not up to standard
(which will be handled through HR disciplinary
procedures); or an exception to a vendor’s contractual
performance. Although these are not all directly related to
Service Management, they will add overheads to the level
of communication required of staff during the Service
Operation phase.

Table B.9 Communication during exceptions

Purpose

Communication during or after exceptions is aimed at:

■ Informing the appropriate people of the exception
■ Assessing the significance, severity and impact of the exception
■ Ensuring that resources with the appropriate skills and seniority are involved in resolving the exception and

taking action to prevent future recurrence

■ Providing updates to stakeholders that are affected by the exception

Frequency

This type of communication is reactive and ad hoc, in that it does not occur unless there is an identified
exception or the risk of an exception. The frequency is thus directly proportional to the frequency of exceptions.

Role Players

Content

Once an exception is detected, the frequency and content of communication will be determined by the impact,
urgency and severity of the exception.

The exact role players will depend on the type and extent of the exception, but could include:
■ Incident Management
■ The Service Desk
■ Problem Management
■ Process owners (if the exception relates to process performance)
■ Departmental managers or team leaders
■ SLM
■ Human Resource Management
■ Technology Managers and experts
■ Vendor account management staff
■ Vendor technical experts
■ Description and assessment of the exception
■ Assessment of the impact. This will typically involve communication with the stakeholders who are affected

by the exception

■ Estimation and then confirmation of the cost of resolution
■ A decision on what action will be taken 
■ Communication of the decision taken. This is likely to be in a number of formats. For example the

communication to customers is likely to contain an apology and a high-level overview of what is being done
to resolve the exception. A communication to the people who are expected to resolve the exception will be
more detailed and will contain clear actions and timelines

■ Confirmation that the exception has been resolved 

Context/sources ■ Process Reviews
■ Change Reviews
■ Service Level Reviews
■ Events
■ Trend Analysis of processes, devices, team performance, etc.
■ Incident, Problem and Change Records
■ Customer satisfaction surveys.

EMERGENCIES

Although ITIL specifies how to deal with urgent, high-
impact situations such as disasters (IT Service Continuity
Management) and Major Incidents (Incident Management),
managers in the Service Operation phase will find
themselves dealing with various types and scales of
emergency not covered in these processes. It is important
to note that this is not a separate process, rather it is a
view of several processes and situations from a
communication perspective.

Communication during emergencies is similar in purpose
and content to communication during exceptions. The

Table B.10 Communication during emergencies

main differences are in the level of urgency and impact of
the exception.

Emergency communications are usually initiated by the
Incident Manager (see paragraph 4.2.5 for a discussion on
Major Incidents) or by a senior IT Manager who has been
designated as the escalation point for all such
emergencies.

In the case where an IT Service Continuity Plan is invoked,
this will include a detailed Communication Plan to be
executed by the appropriate authority.

The Incident Manager or designated manager will often
form a response team, and the communication is initiated
and coordinated by this team.

Purpose

The purpose of communication in an emergency is to immediately investigate and confirm the impact and
severity of the Incident to confirm that it is indeed an emergency situation. It should also confirm that this
Incident does not represent a disaster or any contingency covered in the IT Service Continuity Plans.

As soon as the scope of the emergency has been identified, the team responsible for managing the situation will
allocate resources to create an action plan and to begin resolving the emergency and restoring service.

Frequency

This type of communication does not occur unless there is a Major Incident or emergency situation.

Once an exception is detected, the frequency and content of communication will be determined by the impact
and severity of the exception, and potentially by a Service Recovery Plan.

Role Players

■ Incident Manager
■ Senior Managers of groups responsible for the IT staff that will be required to resolve the situation
■ Business managers and Executives (possibly including legal staff if the organization is exposed to potential

legal action as a result of the incident)

■ Customers and users
■ IT Service Continuity Manager and Central Coordination team 
■ Senior vendor staff and managers (depending on the extent and nature of the situation)·
■ Technical Management staff and managers
■ Application Management staff and managers
■ IT Operations Management staff and managers

Content

■ The nature and extent of the emergency
■ Assessment of the impact. This will typically involve communication with the stakeholders who are affected

by the exception

■ Estimation and then confirmation of the cost of resolution
■ A decision on what action will be taken
■ Communication of the decision taken. This is likely to be in a number of formats. For example the

communication to customers is likely to contain an apology and a high-level overview of what is being done
to resolve the exception. A communication to the people who are expected to resolve the exception will be
more detailed and will contain clear actions and timelines

on internal aspects of Service Operation. The focus is on
the customer or users’ requirements and what IT is doing
to meet them. This should not involve technical
descriptions and detailed information about internal
processes.

COMMUNICATION WITH USERS AND

B8
CUSTOMERS

This section appears last, not because it is the least
important, but because it incorporates several of the areas
discussed above. An important principle in communicating
with customers is that communication should not focus

Table B.11 Communication with users and customers

Purpose

There are a number of reasons for user and customer communication in Service Operation. These include:
■ Ensuring that services have been delivered as agreed
■ Communication around fulfilling Service Requests
■ Reporting Incidents and keeping users and customers updated on their status until resolved
■ Notifying users and customers of changes that may impact them
■ Providing access to services
■ Dealing with potential security issues
■ Scheduling activities that involve users or customers, e.g. maintenance
■ Notification of special business events that require additional support or changed priorities
■ Review of customer and user satisfaction
■ Coordination during contingency situations ·

Frequency

Communication with users and customers is ongoing. The format and content of communication will be defined
by the processes that are being executed. For example, communication about an Incident will be determined by
the Incident Management process.

Role Players

Content

Some communication will be formal and scheduled, e.g. providing reports on the performance of a service
during a review meeting. Other communication will be formal, but ad hoc, e.g. communication about the status
of an Incident

The identity of the role players and their number will depend on which process is being executed, the type of
situation that has occurred and the scope of what is being communicated, e.g. providing an update about the
status of a Service Request will have a very different audience than when participating in a Service Level Review
meeting

The content of this communication will vary depending on the context. However, it is important to gear the
communication to the audience. This means using service names rather than server or application names, being
professional, avoiding technical jargon, not being condescending and treating customers and users with respect

Context/sources

The context of this communication is the day-to-day executing of operational activities and the delivery and
support of services. Service Operation teams should not be communicating with customers or users on planning
issues, strategy, design or testing – unless they have been assigned to a project team which is dealing with one
of these areas

■ Size. What is the size of the problem? How many

parts are affected?

The ‘IS’ situation is determined by the answers to these
questions. The next step is to investigate which similar
parts in a similar environment are functioning properly.
With this, an answer is formulated to the question ‘What
COULD BE but IS NOT?’ (Which parts could be showing
the same problem but do not?).

It is then possible to search effectively for relevant
differences in both situations. Furthermore, past changes,
which could be the cause of these differences, can 
be identified.

C3

ESTABLISHING POSSIBLE CAUSES

The list of differences and changes mentioned above most
likely hold the cause of the problem so possible causes
can be extracted from this list.

C4

TESTING THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE

Each possible cause needs to be assessed to determine
whether it could be the cause of all the symptoms of 
the problem.

C5

VERIFYING THE TRUE CAUSE

The remaining possible causes have to be verified as being
the source of the problem. This can only be done by
proving this in one way or another – for example by
implementing a change or replacing a part. Address 
the possible causes that can be verified quickly and 
simply first.

Charles Kepner and Benjamin Tregoe developed a useful
method to analyse problems. In this appendix, their
method is presented as an example of a Problem Analysis
method.

Kepner and Tregoe state that Problem Analysis should be a
systematic process of problem solving and should take
maximum advantage of knowledge and experience. They
distinguish the following five phases for Problem 
Analysis (described further below):

■ Defining the problem
■ Describing the problem with regard to identity,

location, time and size

■ Establishing possible causes
■ Testing the most probable cause
■ Verifying the true cause.

Depending on time and available information, these
phases can be realized to a greater or lesser extent. Even
in situations where only a limited amount of information is
available, or time pressure is high, it is worthwhile
adopting a structured approach to Problem Analysis to
improve the chances of success.

C1 DEFINING THE PROBLEM

Because the investigation is based on the definition of the
problem, this definition has to state precisely which
deviation(s) from the agreed service levels have occurred.

Often, during the definition of a problem, the most likely
problem cause is already indicated. Take care not to jump
to conclusions, which can guide the investigation in the
wrong direction from the beginning.

In practice, problem definition is often a difficult task
because of a complicated IT Infrastructure and non-
transparent agreements on service levels.

C2 DESCRIBING THE PROBLEM

The following aspects are used to describe the problem,
i.e. what the problem IS:

■ Identity. Which part does not function well? What is

the problem?

■ Location. Where does the problem occur?
■ Time. When did the problem start to occur? How

frequently has the problem occurred?

Appendix D: Ishikawa Diagrams

The Ishikawa Diagram, also known as the Fishbone, Cause-
and-Effect or Tree Diagram, is a tool used for systematically
identifying and presenting all the possible causes of a
particular problem on a chart. The technique is named
after its developer, Kaoru Ishikawa (1915-89), a leader in
Japanese quality control. An example is shown below.

The main goal is represented by the spine or trunk of the
diagram and primary factors are represented as branches.
Secondary factors are then added as stems, and so on.
Creating the diagram stimulates discussion and often leads
to increased understanding of a complex problem. These
diagrams are extensively used in identifying solutions to
systemic problems, such as identifying the cause of
productivity loss on assembly lines, or lower customer
satisfaction levels in a service organization.

The basic technique of developing these diagrams,
together with a very simple example, is shown here. A
problem-solving team will use the Ishikawa Diagram as
follows:

1 Prepare a blank diagram in a format that can be

viewed by the entire group. This could be a flipchart,
board, projected through a data projector from a PC,
etc.

2 Define the problem that the group is trying to solve in

clear and specific terms and write it in the box at the
‘fish head’ box of the diagram.

3 Write the cause categories into the tips of the ‘fish

bones’. These should be fairly broad categories as the
exact causes are not yet known. An example is shown
in Figure D.1 in which the group is trying to find the
cause for unacceptable levels of network downtime.

Appendix E: Detailed description of Facilities
Management

The purpose of this appendix is not to provide a detailed
explanation of all aspects of Facilities Management. Rather,
it will highlight the most important activities to assist in
positioning some of the other functions and in identifying
where specific processes impact on good Facilities
Management and vice versa.

Facilities Management will provide information to
Configuration Management regarding the location and
status of CIs, and will also be an integral part of Change
Management, Capacity and Availability Planning and
Service Continuity Management.

The main components of Facilities Management are as
follows.

E1

BUILDING MANAGEMENT

Although many Building Management activities are
outsourced or contracted to other suppliers, they are still
the responsibility of Facilities Management. Typical
activities include:

■ Cleaning. This could be done by employees or by

third parties. It is very important here to ensure that
cleaning staff comply with all access control and
confidentiality policies.

■ Waste disposal, including separation of items for

recycling, hazardous items (e.g. batteries, liquids and
gases such as refrigerant for air-conditioning units),
confidential documentation.

■ Installation of physical facilities, such as cabling,
power, raised floors, secure entry and exit systems,
offices, furniture, etc.

■ Parking. This should include allocation of staff and
contractor parking, visitors’ parking and parking for
handicapped staff or visitors. Facilities management
will also include documenting and enforcing any
policies around who should park where.

■ Access Control and Security Monitoring. This is

covered in more detail in section E6 below and also in
Appendix F.

■ Signage, i.e. ensuring that the building can be found

but is not obviously a key location worthy of attack.

E2

EQUIPMENT HOSTING

Facilities are not managed simply because they exist and
are owned by an organization. They are managed so that
the people and equipment they contain can be used for
specific purposes. In the case of IT Facilities, such as Data
Centres, this adds some very specific demands to the
manager of that facility.

One of these is the hosting of IT equipment. This is not
just a case of providing a room and allowing the 
Technical Management teams to install and manage
equipment. Different types of equipment have very
specific requirements of the facility in which it is housed,
for example:

■ Water-cooled equipment needs access to cool water –

which has to be supplied by the facility

■ The weight of equipment varies and has to be
distributed so as not to place too much stress 
on the floor

■ Electrical supply may vary for different types of

equipment.

If equipment is simply placed in the Data Centre in the
order in which it is received, it will be very difficult to find
anything and staff may have to cross the floor several
times to tend to similar equipment. This traffic jeopardizes
the integrity and security of other equipment on the floor.

This means that Facilities Management has to own the
responsibility of planning and designing the layout of the
Data Centre for optimal access and security of the
equipment that will be hosted there. At the same time, it
should be remembered that this equipment is being used
to deliver IT services, and any requirements for that service
need to be taken into account in hosting the equipment.
For example, Data Centre standards may have to be
changed in order to accommodate a non-standard server.

In addition, most Data Centres also offer the following
hosting activities:

■ Receipt of new equipment
■ Unpacking, configuring and installing standard

equipment

■ Producing and maintaining Data Centre layout

diagrams

210 | Appendix E: Detailed description of Facilities Management

■ Managing the schedule of any maintenance activity to

equipment hosted in the Data Centre

■ Disposing of retired equipment.

From this list of activities, it is clear that Facilities
Management should not be seen as a separate function,
but very much part of the overall operation of IT in the
organization.

E3

POWER MANAGEMENT

Power Management refers to managing the sourcing and
utilization of power sources that are used to keep the
facility functional. This definition of Power Management
has a number of implications, which are discussed below.

Facilities Management’s first task in managing power is to
determine the power requirements for the facility. This
includes defining:

■ What the power is going to be needed for – e.g. office

space, equipment in the Data Centre, the cafeteria,
etc.

■ When that power is going to be needed. Some

operations require a consistent supply of electricity 
24 hours a day. Others, such as office space, will use
more electricity during the day and very little at night.
Others only need electricity at a specific time

■ How much power is going to be needed
■ What type of power will be used. Although most

organizations use electricity, in many locations the
heating systems are dependent on natural gas.

Facilities Management will also be responsible for
establishing a contract with utility companies, or in many
cases the local authority or municipality that provides 
that service. This will include an agreed rate and a 
level of availability. This has become very important in
locations where the electricity supply is variable due 
to lack of infrastructure or due to over-utilization by
general consumers.

Facilities Management will be responsible for establishing
standby power sources for power failures, disasters and
other contingencies. This is generally in the form of
Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs) for key equipment,
and also generators powered by an alternative energy
source (usually diesel). Facilities Management is
responsible not only for supplying these alternatives, but
also for testing them, keeping supplies of the fuel and
maintaining them.

It needs to be said that any alternative power source
needs to be modelled and tested to ensure that it is able

to handle the required demand and also that it will
automatically be activated following a power failure.

Another key activity of Facilities Management is to manage
the utilization of power. Traditionally, the role of Facilities
Management was just to ensure that power was available.
However, as natural resources become scarcer and
expensive, more attention is being focused on techniques
to manage utilization more responsibly.

One such approach is the dynamic management of power
in Data Centres. The principle is that during peak
processing periods, more computers will be used to do
the work. As the workload reduces, the work is centralized
onto fewer computers, while those that are not being
utilized are powered down or placed into standby mode.
This requires a significant integration between the
activities of IT Operations Management, Technical
Management and all the Service Design processes. This is
discussed in more detail under the section about Data
Centre strategies.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONING AND

E4
ALERT SYSTEMS

Facilities Management ensures that physical conditions
within the Data Centres or computer rooms are
maintained at the correct levels for optimal IT Operations.
These conditions include:

■ Temperature
■ Humidity
■ Air quality
■ Freedom from environmental risks, such as fire,

flooding, etc.

Temperature is maintained through heating and cooling
systems, as well as the layout of the equipment in the
facility. This will require the following activities:

■ Ascertaining the heat output for CIs and their optimal

operating temperature.

■ Identifying the total cooling requirement for all

equipment in the facility as well as for specific items.
For example, an air conditioner may be able to keep a
Data Centre at a constant temperature, but there may
be equipment that needs to be kept at a lower
temperature.

■ Modelling the overall heating and cooling

requirements as well as mapping specific areas in the
facility that may be naturally warmer or cooler. This
information is used to identify where the best location
is for specific equipment. It is important to note that
when new equipment is installed in a facility, it will

Appendix E: Detailed description of Facilities Management  | 211

change the mapping of cooler and warmer areas in
the facility, hence the requirement for more
sophisticated mapping and modelling techniques.
These models will also need to take into account
seasonal variances in temperature. For example, some
facilities may need to be heated in winter and cooled
in summer.

■ Purchase and maintenance of air conditioning units
with sufficient capacity, and maintaining these units
regularly.

■ Investing in backup air-conditioning units that can be

used if a main unit fails, or to provide extra cooling
capacity on exceptionally hot days (although this
should be a rare exception – if the backup unit is
used too frequently this implies that initial planning
was inadequate).

■ Ongoing monitoring of the temperature and

adjustment of cooling settings according to changes
in season and equipment layout. These monitors could
be linked to the Operations Bridge, which would be
able to respond to any significant deviation from
normal temperatures.

■ Identifying and avoiding ‘obvious’ errors, such as

locating the heat output of a major server close to the
intake of an air-conditioning unit; or preventing airflow
by stacking manuals in ‘free’ space.

Similar steps should be taken to identify ideal humidity
levels and specify whether dehumidifying equipment 
is required.

Smoke detection equipment is usually installed as part of
the overall fire control strategy of the facility and is linked
to automated fire-fighting systems. However, Facilities
Management should not assume that an automated
response to fire threats will be adequate. Smoke detection
units should be linked to the Operations Bridge and any
exceptions should be investigated.

Movement detection units should be installed in all
unattended operating areas. These will ensure that
unauthorized access is detected and reported to Facilities
Security and possibly also the Operations Bridge. This will
help to enforce proper scheduling of maintenance or
installation activities.

Dust and particle detection can assist in maintaining air
quality around systems that are particularly sensitive.
Again, monitors should be routed to the Operations Bridge
so that deviations can be investigated and corrected
before any significant damage occurs.

There are also a number of other types of facilities
monitoring, which are based on the location of the facility.

For example, building movement monitors installed in
locations with high levels of seismic activity. These act as
early warning systems to indicate that a system needs to
be shut down or failed over to an alternative site before a
significant earth tremor or earthquake affects sensitive
equipment. Similar monitors and safeguards are also 
being installed in facilities where there is high electrical
storm activity.

These systems are collectively referred to as Building
Management Systems (BMSs), although as these tools are
integrated, the term is being used to refer to a single
integrated management system, rather than a loose
collection of tools performing similar functions. Thought
should be given to using monitoring tools that are
integrated into, or at least consistent with, existing
monitoring tools. (See Chapter 7 for more details 
on tools.)

E5

SAFETY

A major concern of Facilities Management is the safety of
the people working in the building. Facilities Management
is therefore responsible for understanding and enforcing
compliance with relevant safety standards and legislation.

Safety is enforced in the following areas:

■ Building design and construction
■ Layout of the rooms and equipment in the facility
■ Education of all personnel about safety standards in

force in the facility

■ Definition of evacuation procedures and routes and
gathering points in the event of a fire or other life-
threatening situation

■ Posting notices and information regarding any safety

information of which personnel need to be aware.

E6

PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL

This is a very important part of Facilities Management and
has grown into a specialized field. As such, the content is
summarized here for convenience, but discussed in detail
in Appendix F.

The major components of Physical Access Control (as
discussed in Appendix F) are:

■ Assistance in defining and maintaining Physical Access
Controls as part of the organization’s Security Policies

■ Maintenance of floor plans indicating which areas 

are restricted

■ Installation and maintenance of physical access 

control devices

212 | Appendix E: Detailed description of Facilities Management

■ Telecommunications facilities. Although

telecommunications is usually managed by a
dedicated team or department or as part of Wide Area
Networking, they are often dependent on third parties
to supply and maintain telecommunication equipment
located in or just outside the Data Centre. In many
countries these are provided by government or para-
state telecommunications organizations. Management
of these types of contracts requires a special skill set.
■ Security services for the provision of physical access

control and armed response services.

A very important part of Contract Management is to
ensure that all third-party staff are aware of, and comply
with, the security policies of the organization. This
includes physical access control, confidentiality and
unauthorized use of the organization’s facilities or
equipment. Regular audits should be held to ensure that
this is being enforced.

E9 MAINTENANCE

Facilities Management is responsible for coordinating all
routine maintenance activity within the building. This
refers to both building maintenance as well as to the
maintenance of equipment in the Data Centre.

The reason for including equipment maintenance is simply
to prevent the building being exposed to too much
unusual activity at any one time. Multiple teams working
in different places in the Data Centre at the same time
represents a security and safety risk.

It is important to note that the actual maintenance of IT
equipment is carried out by the Technical Management
staff, but under the coordination of Change Management
and Facilities Management.

The Facilities Manager should maintain a master schedule
of all planned maintenance activity to ensure that
maintenance activity is properly coordinated. This
schedule forms part of the overall Change Management
Change Schedule and is used to ensure that there are no
conflicts between routine maintenance activity and the
deployment of changes.

■ Monitoring and control of access to facilities
■ Security staffing
■ Installation and maintenance of surveillance

equipment

■ Protection against social engineering.

E7

SHIPPING AND RECEIVING

Large facilities require special areas where delivery can be
taken of furniture, computer equipment, racks, etc. This
area needs to be secured so that delivery personnel do
not gain access to the rest of the facility. There also 
needs to be a secure store near the receiving area where
items can be stored until they can be moved to their 
final location.

A process needs to be in place to ensure that items to be
shipped are accounted for and that only those items are
removed by the delivery or dispatch contractor. Wherever
possible, these items should be marshalled into the secure
store in the shipping and delivery area before being
dispatched. This will prevent unauthorized access 
to the facility.

Delivery and dispatch documentation has to be
completed, inspected and signed for each consignment
that is delivered or dispatched. A central log of all
consignments should also be maintained as a control.

INVOLVEMENT IN CONTRACT

E8
MANAGEMENT

Most facilities are supplied, managed and serviced by a
number of entities. Although the actual contracts with
these entities would be typically be managed by the
appropriate commercial and legal departments, Facilities
Management will play a key role in specifying and
negotiating these contracts. Typical contracts include:

■ Management of leases for leased properties. This is

quite rare, as most organizations view their Data
Centre as a key asset. Leasing such facilities would be
seen as a risk because of the potential that the
building is sold, the lessor goes out of business 
or the lessor does not fulfil the contract in terms of
proper maintenance.

■ Leasing or maintenance of environmental

equipment, such as air-conditioning units,
environmental monitoring and alert (e.g. smoke
detection and fire-fighting or suppression equipment).

■ Building maintenance contracts. These include

servicing of elevators, flooring, plumbing and 
electrical supply.

FAppendix F: 

Physical Access Control

| 215

Appendix F: Physical Access Control

Section 5.12 and Appendix E introduced the area of
Physical Access Control as part of Facilities Management.
This section provides a more detailed discussion of 
this area.

Information Security Management is responsible for
defining and documenting all access control policies.
These polices will identify all physical security measures
that need to be taken and which groups of employee
should have access to what type of facility. Facilities
Management will ensure that these policies are properly
enforced. Policies should include:

■ Which areas are restricted and to whom
■ What access controls will be put in place
■ Under what circumstances access will be allowed to
specific restricted areas. For example, preventing all
access to a Data Centre floor unless an authorized RFC
number is typed into a keypad

■ How access control will be monitored
■ A statement of privacy policies and what information

has to be known in order to permit access

■ Policies regarding the surveillance of personnel, e.g.

what may be recorded, where and whether there are
any exceptions.

Most organizations use multiple levels of access control,
starting with access to the property, then moving to
access to specific areas in the building and then to specific
functions, equipment or rooms. Each level of security is
enforced using different mechanisms and personnel, thus
providing additional security.

All facilities should have a documented, current floor plan
which indicates exactly which areas are restricted and
which are not. This plan will also indicate which security
measures are implemented and where. This will aid in
security audits and also for the maintenance of access
control equipment.

Access control devices need to be installed on all
entrances and exits. The aim of these devices is to ensure
that only authorized personnel have access to the
restricted area. Although this appears at first glance to be
a fairly straightforward subject, there are a number of
items that need to be taken into account (See Table F.1).

Table F.1 Access control devices
Access control

Example

to enter. The same key card can
not be used to enter a second
person

Easier to control access
Prevents social engineering more
effectively

Could become a bottleneck at
peak hours
Requires more intensive
surveillance and staffing

Revolving door allowing only
access or only exit. Typically used
in airports where security
personnel are only concerned
about people entering the airport,
but not about those exiting

Good for situations where there is
no need to monitor what people
take out, but where things they
take in could cause significant
damage

Bi-directional access

Access-controlled door

Good for general access to
restricted areas

Active

Passive

Requires action by personnel to
gain access, e.g. swiping a key
card or punching a code

Passive detector unlocks an exit
from inside whenever someone
approaches

Easier to control access
More secure

Provides safer exit in the event of
a fire
Does not require key cards for
people moving to non-secure
areas

Requires more monitoring to
ensure that people do not attempt
to go through the wrong direction
Typically uni-directional; also
implies additional scanning
equipment and surveillance

People exiting can provide access
to unauthorized personnel moving
in
Could be a bottleneck (e.g. in bi-
directional turnstiles people going
out have to wait for people
coming in)

Requires personnel to remember a
code or to bring a key card

Easy for unauthorized personnel to
gain access simply by waiting
outside the door
Can be triggered from the outside
by inserting something under the
door and moving it within range
of the sensor

Appendix F: Physical Access Control  | 217

No matter how secure the environment, it is dependent
on the security awareness of the employees and
contractors who work in the facility. Social engineering is
still one of the most common breaches of physical
security. Social engineering refers to the practice of
gaining entry to a facility by using interpersonal and
communication skills to convince someone to allow
unauthorized access to a building, restricted area,
restricted equipment and data; or to cabinets containing
confidential documents.

Examples of social engineering include:

■ Posing as a legitimate contractor or employee of the

organization. The usual technique is to approach
security personnel and state that they have forgotten
their access card. An Access Log is signed and a
visitor’s card produced. There is often no real checking
of whether the person is a legitimate employee,
especially in busy reception areas.

■ Posing as someone who has a reason to gain

unauthorized access to the facility, e.g. a utilities
worker or fire inspector.

■ An ex-employee or contractor approaching people
with whom they are familiar to allow them access.

■ ‘Tailgating’, where a person simply follows an

authorized employee through an entrance that they
have opened.

Social engineering is best countered by enforcing strict
compliance with access control procedures, continuing
education programmes, regular briefings of security
personnel and stringent audits.

A growing number of companies offer services to test the
rigour of access control with people who specialize in
using social engineering techniques.

As most physical access control mechanisms are not
foolproof, it is important to ensure that access can be
monitored and controlled. This is done by specialized
security staff and by electronic surveillance equipment.

Since security is all about managing the access of people
to a facility, it is fitting that people are used to enforce
security measures. Larger organizations sometimes provide
their own security staff, but most tend to outsource
physical access control to specialized companies. This is
usually for the following reasons:

■ Security guards require specialized training and are

usually subject to a different (almost military)
disciplinary code from most company employees. This
is often in conflict with the more commercial type of
disciplinary code and is best managed by a different
set of managers using a different management culture.

■ External companies are less likely to be influenced by
social engineering situations, as they have specialised
training and are unlikely to understand some of the
organization’s internal nuances that could be used by
an experienced social engineer.

Surveillance equipment is used to extend the effectiveness
of both the physical access control mechanisms and the
security personnel. It is important to note that no
surveillance equipment can replace the presence of a
trained, aware security guard, merely extend their
effectiveness. Examples of commonly used surveillance
equipment include:

■ Video cameras to monitor key access points and also

in less used access points, thus allowing a security
guard to monitor several locations at once. These are
usually taped and the videos stored for some time
before being used again. This is to ensure that if any
wrongdoing is discovered, the tapes can be used in
the investigation. This means that the quality of
images must be good enough to facilitate
identification of people, but it also has to be in a
format that makes it easy to store vast quantities of
visual data.

■ Access Event Logs. These typically log every entrance

and exit by personnel using electronic access
mechanisms.

■ Passive detection units to detect the presence of
personnel in an area that should not be staffed.

■ Alarms that will notify security staff of unauthorized

access or exit, often linked to an audible alarm.

The publication names included in parentheses after the
name of a term identify where a reader can find more
information about that term. This is either because the
term is primarily used by that publication or because
additional useful information about that term can be
found there. Terms without a publication name associated
with them may be used generally by several publications,
or may not be defined in any greater detail than can be
found in the glossary, i.e. we only point readers to
somewhere they can expect to expand on their knowledge
or to see a greater context. Terms with multiple publication
names are expanded on in multiple publications.

Where the definition of a term includes another term,
those related terms are highlighted in a second colour.
This is designed to help the reader with their
understanding by pointing them to additional definitions
that are all part of the original term they were interested
in. The form ‘See also Term X, Term Y’ is used at the end of
a definition where an important related term is not used
with the text of the definition itself.

Balanced Scorecard
(Continual Service Improvement) A management tool
developed by Drs Robert Kaplan (Harvard Business School)
and David Norton. A Balanced Scorecard enables a
Strategy to be broken down into Key Performance
Indicators. Performance against the KPIs is used to
demonstrate how well the Strategy is being achieved. A
Balanced Scorecard has four major areas, each of which
has a small number of KPIs. The same four areas are
considered at different levels of detail throughout the
Organization.

Baseline
(Continual Service Improvement) A Benchmark used as a
reference point. For example:

■ An ITSM Baseline can be used as a starting point to

measure the effect of a Service Improvement Plan

■ A Performance Baseline can be used to measure
changes in Performance over the lifetime of an IT
Service

■ A Configuration Management Baseline can be used to
enable the IT Infrastructure to be restored to a known
Configuration if a Change or Release fails.

Benchmark
(Continual Service Improvement) The recorded state of
something at a specific point in time. A Benchmark can be
created for a Configuration, a Process, or any other set of
data. For example, a benchmark can be used in: 

■ Continual Service Improvement, to establish the

current state for managing improvements

■ Capacity Management, to document performance

characteristics during normal operations.

See also Benchmarking, Baseline.

Benchmarking
(Continual Service Improvement) Comparing a Benchmark
with a Baseline or with Best Practice. The term
Benchmarking is also used to mean creating a series of
Benchmarks over time, and comparing the results to
measure progress or improvement. 

Best Practice

used by multiple Organizations. ITIL is an example of Best
Practice.

Brainstorming
(Service Design) A technique that helps a team to
generate ideas. Ideas are not reviewed during the
Brainstorming session, but at a later stage. Brainstorming is
often used by Problem Management to identify possible
causes.

Budget
A list of all the money an Organization or Business Unit
plans to receive, and plans to pay out, over a specified
period of time. See also Budgeting, Planning.

Budgeting
The Activity of predicting and controlling the spending of
money. Consists of a periodic negotiation cycle to set
future Budgets (usually annual) and the day-to-day
monitoring and adjusting of current Budgets.

Build
(Service Transition) The Activity of assembling a number of
Configuration Items to create part of an IT Service. The
term Build is also used to refer to a Release that is
authorized for distribution. For example Server Build or
laptop Build.

Organization formed of a number of Business Units. In the
context of ITSM, the term Business includes public sector
and not-for-profit organizations, as well as companies. An
IT Service Provider provides IT Services to a Customer
within a Business. The IT Service Provider may be part of
the same Business as its Customer (Internal Service
Provider), or part of another Business (External Service
Provider).

Business Capacity Management (BCM)
(Service Design) In the context of ITSM, Business Capacity
Management is the Activity responsible for understanding
future Business Requirements for use in the Capacity Plan.
See also Service Capacity Management.

most efficient use of Resources. Tuning is part of
Performance Management, which also includes
Performance monitoring and implementation of the
required Changes.

Underpinning Contract (UC)
(Service Design) A Contract between an IT Service Provider
and a Third Party. The Third Party provides goods or
Services that support delivery of an IT Service to a
Customer. The Underpinning Contract defines targets and
responsibilities that are required to meet agreed Service
Level Targets in an SLA.

Unit Cost
(Service Strategy) The Cost to the IT Service Provider
of providing a single Component of an IT Service. For
example the Cost of a single desktop PC, or of a single
Transaction.

Urgency
(Service Transition) (Service Design) A measure of how
long it will be until an Incident, Problem or Change has a
significant Impact on the Business. For example a high
Impact Incident may have low Urgency, if the Impact will
not affect the Business until the end of the financial year.

Each User Profile includes one or more Patterns of
Business Activity.

Utility
(Service Strategy) Functionality offered by a Product or
Service to meet a particular need. Utility is often
summarized as ‘what it does’.

Validation
(Service Transition) An Activity that ensures a new or
changed IT Service, Process, Plan, or other Deliverable
meets the needs of the Business. Validation ensures that
Business Requirements are met even though these may
have changed since the original design. See also
Verification, Acceptance, Qualification.

Value for Money
An informal measure of Cost Effectiveness. Value for
Money is often based on a comparison with the Cost of
alternatives. See also Cost Benefit Analysis.

Value Network
