4.1 EVENT MANAGEMENT
An event can be defined as any detectable or discernible
occurrence that has significance for the management of
the IT Infrastructure or the delivery of IT service and
evaluation of the impact a deviation might cause to the
services. Events are typically notifications created by an IT
service, Configuration Item (CI) or monitoring tool.
Effective Service Operation is dependent on knowing the
status of the infrastructure and detecting any deviation
from normal or expected operation. This is provided by
good monitoring and control systems, which are based on
two types of tools:
� active monitoring tools that poll key CIs to determine
their status and availability. Any exceptions will
generate an alert that needs to be communicated to
the appropriate tool or team for action
� passive monitoring tools that detect and correlate
operational alerts or communications generated by
CIs.
4.1.1 Purpose/goal/objective
The ability to detect events, make sense of them and
determine the appropriate control action is provided by
Event Management. Event Management is therefore the
basis for Operational Monitoring and Control (see
Appendix B).
In addition, if these events are programmed to
communicate operational information as well as warnings
and exceptions, they can be used as a basis for
automating many routine Operations Management
activities, for example executing scripts on remote devices,
or submitting jobs for processing, or even dynamically
balancing the demand for a service across multiple devices
to enhance performance.
Event Management therefore provides the entry point for
the execution of many Service Operation processes and
activities. In addition, it provides a way of comparing
actual performance and behaviour against design
standards and SLAs. As such, Event Management also
provides a basis for Service Assurance and Reporting; and
Service Improvement. This is covered in detail in the
Continual Service Improvement publication.
4.1.2 Scope
Event Management can be applied to any aspect of
Service Management that needs to be controlled and
which can be automated. These include:
� Configuration Items:
? Some CIs will be included because they need to
stay in a constant state (e.g. a switch on a network
needs to stay on and Event Management tools
confirm this by monitoring responses to �pings�).
? Some CIs will be included because their status
needs to change frequently and Event
Management can be used to automate this and
update the CMS (e.g. the updating of a file server).
� Environmental conditions (e.g. fire and smoke
detection)
� Software licence monitoring for usage to ensure
optimum/legal licence utilization and allocation
� Security (e.g. intrusion detection)
� Normal activity (e.g. tracking the use of an application
or the performance of a server).
The difference between monitoring and Event
Management
These two areas are very closely related, but slightly
different in nature. Event Management is focused on
generating and detecting meaningful notifications
about the status of the IT Infrastructure and services.
While it is true that monitoring is required to detect
and track these notifications, monitoring is broader
than Event Management. For example, monitoring
tools will check the status of a device to ensure that
it is operating within acceptable limits, even if that
device is not generating events.
Put more simply, Event Management works with
occurrences that are specifically generated to be
monitored. Monitoring tracks these occurrences, but
it will also actively seek out conditions that do not
generate events.
4.1.3 Value to business
Event Management�s value to the business is generally
indirect; however, it is possible to determine the basis for
its value as follows:
� Event Management provides mechanisms for early
detection of incidents. In many cases it is possible for
the incident to be detected and assigned to the
appropriate group for action before any actual service
outage occurs.
� Event Management makes it possible for some types
of automated activity to be monitored by exception �
thus removing the need for expensive and resource
intensive real-time monitoring, while reducing
downtime.
� When integrated into other Service Management
processes (such as, for example, Availability or Capacity
Management), Event Management can signal status
changes or exceptions that allow the appropriate
person or team to perform early response, thus
improving the performance of the process. This, in
turn, will allow the business to benefit from more
effective and more efficient Service Management
overall.
� Event Management provides a basis for automated
operations, thus increasing efficiencies and allowing
expensive human resources to be used for more
innovative work, such as designing new or improved
functionality or defining new ways in which the
business can exploit technology for increased
competitive advantage.
