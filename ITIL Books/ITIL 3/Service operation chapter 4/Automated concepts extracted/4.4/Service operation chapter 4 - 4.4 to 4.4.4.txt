4.4 PROBLEM MANAGEMENT
ITIL defines a �problem� as the unknown cause of one or
more incidents.
4.4.1 Purpose/goal/objective
Problem Management is the process responsible for
managing the lifecycle of all problems. The primary
objectives of Problem Management are to prevent
problems and resulting incidents from happening, to
eliminate recurring incidents and to minimize the impact
of incidents that cannot be prevented.
4.4.2 Scope
Problem Management includes the activities required to
diagnose the root cause of incidents and to determine the
resolution to those problems. It is also responsible for
ensuring that the resolution is implemented through the
appropriate control procedures, especially Change
Management and Release Management.
Problem Management will also maintain information
about problems and the appropriate workarounds and
resolutions, so that the organization is able to reduce the
number and impact of incidents over time. In this respect,
Problem Management has a strong interface with
Knowledge Management, and tools such as the Known
Error Database will be used for both.
Although Incident and Problem Management are separate
processes, they are closely related and will typically use
the same tools, and may use similar categorization, impact
and priority coding systems. This will ensure effective
communication when dealing with related incidents and
problems.
4.4.3 Value to business
Problem Management works together with Incident
Management and Change Management to ensure that IT
service availability and quality are increased. When
incidents are resolved, information about the resolution is
recorded. Over time, this information is used to speed up
the resolution time and identify permanent solutions,
reducing the number and resolution time of incidents. This
results in less downtime and less disruption to business
critical systems.
Additional value is derived from the following:
� Higher availability of IT services
� Higher productivity of business and IT staff
� Reduced expenditure on workarounds or fixes that do
not work
� Reduction in cost of effort in fire-fighting or resolving
repeat incidents.
