4.5 ACCESS MANAGEMENT
Access Management is the process of granting authorized
users the right to use a service, while preventing access to
non-authorized users. It has also been referred to as Rights
Management or Identity Management in different
organizations.
4.5.1 Purpose/goal/objective
Access Management provides the right for users to be able
to use a service or group of services. It is therefore the
execution of policies and actions defined in Security and
Availability Management.
4.5.2 Scope
Access Management is effectively the execution of both
Availability and Information Security Management, in that
it enables the organization to manage the confidentiality,
availability and integrity of the organization�s data and
intellectual property.
Access Management ensures that users are given the right
to use a service, but it does not ensure that this access is
available at all agreed times � this is provided by
Availability Management.
Access Management is a process that is executed by all
Technical and Application Management functions and is
usually not a separate function. However, there is likely to
be a single control point of coordination, usually in IT
Operations Management or on the Service Desk.
Access Management can be initiated by a Service Request
through the Service Desk.
4.5.3 Value to business
Access Management provides the following value:
� Controlled access to services ensures that the
organization is able to maintain more effectively the
confidentiality of its information
� Employees have the right level of access to execute
their jobs effectively
� There is less likelihood of errors being made in data
entry or in the use of a critical service by an unskilled
user (e.g. production control systems)
� The ability to audit use of services and to trace the
abuse of services
� The ability more easily to revoke access rights when
needed � an important security consideration
� May be needed for regulatory compliance (e.g. SOX,
HIPAA, COBIT).
