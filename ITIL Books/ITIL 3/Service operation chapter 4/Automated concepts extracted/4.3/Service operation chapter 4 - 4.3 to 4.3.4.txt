4.3 REQUEST FULFILMENT
The term �Service Request� is used as a generic description
for many varying types of demands that are placed upon
the IT Department by the users. Many of these are actually
small changes � low risk, frequently occurring, low cost,
etc. (e.g. a request to change a password, a request to
install an additional software application onto a particular
workstation, a request to relocate some items of desktop
equipment) or maybe just a question requesting
information � but their scale and frequent, low-risk nature
means that they are better handled by a separate process,
rather than being allowed to congest and obstruct the
normal Incident and Change Management processes.
4.3.1 Purpose/goal/objective
Request Fulfilment is the processes of dealing with Service
Requests from the users. The objectives of the Request
Fulfilment process include:
� To provide a channel for users to request and receive
standard services for which a pre-defined approval and
qualification process exists
� To provide information to users and customers about
the availability of services and the procedure for
obtaining them
� To source and deliver the components of requested
standard services (e.g. licences and software media)
� To assist with general information, complaints or
comments.
4.3.2 Scope
The process needed to fulfil a request will vary depending
upon exactly what is being requested � but can usually be
broken down into a set of activities that have to be
performed. Some organizations will be comfortable to let
the Service Requests be handled through their Incident
Management processes (and tools) � with Service Requests
being handled as a particular type of �incident� (using a
high-level categorization system to identify those
�incidents� that are in fact Service Requests).
Note, however, that there is a significant difference here �
an incident is usually an unplanned event whereas a
Service Request is usually something that can and should
be planned!
Therefore, in an organization where large numbers of
Service Requests have to be handled, and where the
actions to be taken to fulfil those requests are very varied
or specialized, it may be appropriate to handle Service
Requests as a completely separate work stream � and to
record and manage them as a separate record type.
This may be particularly appropriate if the organization
has chosen to widen the scope of the Service Desk to
expand upon just IT-related issues and use the desk as a
focal point for other types or request for service � for
example, a request to service a photocopier or even going
so far as to include, for example, building management
issues, such as a need to replace a light fitment or repair a
leak in the plumbing.
Note: It will ultimately be up to each organization to
decide and document which request it will handle
through the Request Fulfilment process and which others
will have to go through more formal Change
Management. There will always be grey areas which
prevent generic guidance from being usefully prescribed.
4.3.3 Value to business
The value of Request Fulfilment is to provide quick and
effective access to standard services which business staff
can use to improve their productivity or the quality of
business services and products.
Request Fulfilment effectively reduces the bureaucracy
involved in requesting and receiving access to existing or
new services, thus also reducing the cost of providing
these services. Centralizing fulfilment also increases the
level of control over these services. This in turn can help
reduce costs through centralized negotiation with
suppliers, and can also help to reduce the cost of support.
