restricting access to non-authorized users .', 'Access Management has also been called Identity or Rights Management in some organizations .', '4.5 ACCESS MANAGEMENT Access Management is the process of granting authorized users the right to use a service , while preventing access to non-authorized users .', '4.5.1 Purpose/goal/objective Access Management provides the right for users to be able to use a service or group of services .', '4.5.2 Scope Access Management is effectively the execution of both Availability and Information Security Management , in that it enables the organization to manage the confidentiality , availability and integrity of the organizationï¿½s data and intellectual property .', 'Access Management ensures that users are given the right to use a service , but it does not ensure that this access is available at all agreed times ï¿½ this is provided by Availability Management .', 'Access Management is a process that is executed by all Technical and Application Management functions and is usually not a separate function .', 'Access Management can be initiated by a Service Request through the Service Desk .', '4.5.3 Value to business Access Management provides the following value : ï¿½ Controlled access to services ensures that the organization is able to maintain more effectively the confidentiality of its information ï¿½ Employees have the right level of access to execute their jobs effectively ï¿½ There is less likelihood of errors being made in data entry or in the use of a critical service by an unskilled user ( e.g .', '4.5.4

not decide who has access to which IT services .', 'Rather , Access Management executes the policies and regulations defined during Service Strategy and Service Design .', 'Access Management enforces decisions to restrict or provide access , rather than making the decision .', 'As soon as a user has been verified , Access Management will provide that user with rights to use the requested service .', 'Each exception should be coordinated by Access Management and approved through the originating process .', 'Access Management should perform a regular review of the roles and groups that it has created and manage to ensure that they are appropriate for the services that IT delivers and supports ï¿½ and obsolete or unwanted roles/groups should be removed .', 'In addition , Access Management , working together with Information Security Management , should take active measures to prevent and detect malicious action against the organization from that user .', 'Access Management should understand and document the typical User Lifecycle for each type of user and use it to automate the process .', 'Access Management tools should provide features that enable a user to be moved from one state to another , or from one group to another , easily and with an audit trail .', '4.5.5.5 Logging and tracking access Access Management should not only respond to requests .', 'Information Security Management plays a vital role in detecting unauthorized access and comparing it with the rights that were provided by Access Management .', 'This will require Access Management involvement in defining the parameters for use in Intrusion Detection tools .', 'Access Management may also be required to provide a record of access for specific Services during forensic investigations .', 'If a user is suspected of breaches of policy , inappropriate use of resources , or fraudulent use of data , Access Management may be required to provide evidence of dates , times and even content of that userï¿½s access to specific Services .', 'This is normally provided by the Operational staff of that service , but working as part of the Access Management process .', '4.5.5.6 Removing or restricting

and tools needed to execute Access Management .', 'There is also a strong relationship between Access Management and Configuration Management .', 'To make it easier for Access Management to provide the appropriate rights , it uses a catalogue of all the roles in the organization and which services support each role .', 'This catalogue of roles should be compiled and maintained by Access Management in conjunction with HR and will often be automated in the Directory Services tools ( see section 5.8 ) .', 'Access Management will assess all the roles that a user plays as well as the groups that they belong to and ensure that they provide rights to use all associated services .', '4.5.8 Metrics Metrics that can be used to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of Access Management include : ï¿½ Number of requests for access ( Service Request , RFC , etc . )', '4.5.9 Challenges , Critical Success Factors and risks Conditions for successful Access Management include : ï¿½ The ability to verify the identity of a user ( that the person is who they say they are ) ï¿½ The ability to verify the identity of the approving person or body ï¿½ The ability to verify that a user qualifies for access to a specific service ï¿½ The ability to link multiple access rights to an individual user ï¿½ The ability to determine the status of the user at any time ( e.g .']\n",

      "What is the definition for \"Process Owner\"?\n",
      "- 1: (Service Operation) A point of contact for Users to log Incidents. A Help Desk is usually more technically focussed than a Service Desk and does not provide a Single Point of Contact for all interaction. The term Help Desk is often used as a synonym for Service Desk.\n",
      "- 2: An Activity responsible for creating one or more Plans. For example, Capacity Planning.\n",
      "- 3: A Role responsible for ensuring that a Process is Fit for Purpose. The Process Ownerâ€™s responsibilities include sponsorship, Design, Change Management and continual improvement of the Process and its Metrics. This Role is often assigned to the same person who carries out the Process Manager Role, but the two Roles may be separate in larger Organizations.\n",
      "- 4: (Service Operation) A technique used to help identify the Business Impact of one or more Problems. A formula is used to calculate Pain Value based on the number of Users affected, the duration of the Downtime, the Impact on each User, and the cost to the Business (if known).\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the definition for \"Key Performance Indicator (KPI)\"?\n",
      "- 1: Anything that might exploit a Vulnerability. Any potential cause of an Incident can be considered to be a Threat. For example a fire is a Threat that could exploit the Vulnerability of flammable floor coverings. This term is commonly used in Information Security Management and IT Service Continuity Management, but also applies to other areas such as Problem and Availability Management.\n",
      "- 2:  (Continual Service Improvement) A Metric that is used to help manage a Process, IT Service or Activity. Many Metrics may be measured, but only the most important of these are defined as KPIs and used to actively manage and report on the Process, IT Service or Activity. KPIs should be selected to ensure that Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Cost Effectiveness are all managed. See also Critical Success Factor.\n",
      "- 3: A possible event that could cause harm or loss, or affect the ability to achieve Objectives. A Risk is measured by the probability of a Threat, the Vulnerability of the Asset to that Threat, and the Impact it would have if it occurred.\n",
      "- 4: The value of a Metric that should cause an Alert to be generated, or management action to be taken. For example â€˜Priority 1 Incident not solved within four hoursâ€™, â€˜more than five soft disk errors in an hourâ€™, or â€˜more than 10 failed changes in a monthâ€™.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the definition for \"Change Advisory Board (CAB)\"?\n",
      "- 1: (Service Operation) A User who helps other Users, and assists in communication with the Service Desk or other parts of the IT Service Provider. Super Users typically provide support for minor Incidents and training.\n",
      "- 2: (Service Transition) A repeatable way of dealing with a particular Category of Change. A Change Model defines specific pre-defined steps that will be followed for a change of this Category. Change Models may be very simple, with no requirement for approval (e.g. Password Reset) or may be very complex with many steps that require approval (e.g. major software release). See also Standard Change, Change Advisory Board.\n",
      "- 3: A measurement of the time taken to respond to something. This could be Response Time of a Transaction, or the speed with which an IT Service Provider responds to an Incident or Request for Change, etc.\n",
      "- 4:  A group of people that advises the Change Manager in the Assessment, prioritization and scheduling of Changes. This board is usually made up of representatives from all areas within the IT Service Provider, representatives from the Business and Third Parties such as Suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the definition for \"Known Error Database (KEDB)\"?\n",
      "- 1: A possible event that could cause harm or loss, or affect the ability to achieve Objectives. A Risk is measured by the probability of a Threat, the Vulnerability of the Asset to that Threat, and the Impact it would have if it occurred.\n",
      "- 2:  A database containing all Known Error Records. This database is created by Problem Management and used by Incident and Problem Management. The Known Error Database is part of the Service Knowledge Management System.\n",
      "- 3: A Document containing the results or other output from a Process or Activity. Records are evidence of the fact that an activity took place and may be paper or electronic. For example, an Audit report, an Incident Record, or the minutes of a meeting.\n",
      "- 4: (Service Transition) A subset of the Change Advisory Board that makes decisions about high-impact Emergency Changes. Membership of the ECAB may be decided at the time a meeting is called, and depends on the nature of the Emergency Change.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the definition for \"Standby\"?\n",
      "- 1: (Service Operation) The final Status in the Lifecycle of an Incident, Problem, Change, etc. When the Status is Closed, no further action is taken.\n",
      "- 2: (Service Transition) An Activity that ensures that IT Infrastructure is appropriate, and correctly configured, to support an Application or IT Service. See also Validation.\n",
      "- 3:  Used to refer to Resources that are not required to deliver the Live IT Services, but are available to support IT Service Continuity Plans. For example a Standby data centre may be maintained to support Hot Standby, Warm Standby or Cold Standby arrangements.\n",
      "- 4: A Document containing steps that specify how to achieve an Activity. Procedures are defined as part of Processes. See also Work Instruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the definition for \"Recovery\"?\n",
      "- 1:  (Service Operation) Returning a Configuration Item or an IT Service to a working state. Recovery of an IT Service often includes recovering data to a known consistent state. After Recovery, further steps may be needed before the IT Service can be made available to the Users (Restoration).\n",
      "- 2: (Service Transition) The Process responsible for controlling the Lifecycle of all Changes. The primary objective of Change Management is to enable beneficial Changes to be made, with minimum disruption to IT Services.\n",
      "- 3: (Service Strategy) The Function and Processes responsible for managing an IT Service Providerâ€™s Budgeting, Accounting and Charging Requirements.\n",
      "- 4: (Service Operation) A Record containing the details of an Incident. Each Incident record documents the Lifecycle of a single Incident.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the definition for \"Impact\"?\n",
      "- 1:  The Process responsible for managing the Lifecycle of all Service Requests.\n",
      "- 2:  (Service Transition) A measure of the effect of an Incident, Problem or Change on Business Processes. Impact is often based on how Service Levels will be affected. Impact and Urgency are used to assign Priority.\n",
      "- 3:  (Continual Service Improvement) A Metric that is used to help manage a Process, IT Service or Activity. Many Metrics may be measured, but only the most important of these are defined as KPIs and used to actively manage and report on the Process, IT Service or Activity. KPIs should be selected to ensure that Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Cost Effectiveness are all managed. See also Critical Success Factor.\n",
      "- 4: A legally binding Agreement between two or more parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the definition for \"Dependency\"?\n",
      "- 1: A measurement of the time taken to respond to something. This could be Response Time of a Transaction, or the speed with which an IT Service Provider responds to an Incident or Request for Change, etc.\n",
      "- 2: A person, group, or Business that is not part of the Service Level Agreement for an IT Service, but is required to ensure successful delivery of that IT Service. For example, a software Supplier, a hardware maintenance company, or a facilities department. Requirements for Third Parties are typically specified in Underpinning Contracts or Operational Level Agreements.\n",
      "- 3: The direct or indirect reliance of one Process or Activity on another.\n",
      "- 4: Review, Plan and request Changes, in order to obtain the maximum Efficiency and Effectiveness from a Process, Configuration Item, Application, etc.\n",
